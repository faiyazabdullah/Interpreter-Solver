### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Observations from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Shape of the Prism**:
   - The base of the prism is a kite, as indicated by the predicate `Kite(Base1)` and the visual representation of the base in the image.
   - The prism itself is identified by the predicate `Shape(Prism1)`.

2. **Dimensions of the Base**:
   - The base is a kite with a width of 4 cm and a height of 8 cm, as stated by the predicates `WidthOf(Base1, 4)` and `HeightOf(Base1, 8)`.

3. **Height of the Prism**:
   - The height of the prism is given as 2 cm by the predicate `HeightOf(Prism1, 2)`.

4. **Right Angle**:
   - The right angle at `Angle1` indicates that the kite's diagonals intersect perpendicularly. This is visually confirmed in the image.

#### Specific Value to Find:
- The question asks for the volume of the prism. To calculate the volume, we need:
  - The area of the base (kite).
  - The height of the prism.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Calculate the Area of the Kite Base
- The area \( A \) of a kite can be calculated using the formula:
  \[
  A = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
  \]
  where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are the lengths of the diagonals.

- From the image and predicates:
  - The width of the kite (one diagonal, \( d_1 \)) is 4 cm.
  - The height of the kite (the other diagonal, \( d_2 \)) is 8 cm.

- Substituting these values into the formula:
  \[
  A = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 8 = \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16 \text{ cm}^2
  \]

#### Step 2.2: Calculate the Volume of the Prism
- The volume \( V \) of a prism is given by the formula:
  \[
  V = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height}
  \]
- The base area of the prism is the area of the kite, which we calculated as 16 cmÂ².
- The height of the prism is given as 2 cm.

- Substituting these values into the formula:
  \[
  V = 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cm}^3
  \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The volume of the prism is calculated to be 32 cubic centimeters.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{32 \text{ cm}^3}\]
