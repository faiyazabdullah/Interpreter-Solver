QUESTION:
Consider the points on the diagram P, A and N where N denotes the north cardinal point. Angle PAN is 45Â°.

Using the diagram, find the true bearing of P from A.

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the true bearing of point \( P \) from point \( A \). The given information includes:
1. Point \( P \), point \( A \), and point \( N \), where \( N \) is the north cardinal point.
2. The angle \( \angle P A N = 45^\circ \).
3. The lines \( A P \) and \( A N \) form the angle at point \( A \).

The goal is to determine the true bearing of \( P \) from \( A \). True bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction.

---

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the predicates and the diagram:
- \( \angle P A N = 45^\circ \): This is the angle formed between the line \( A P \) and the north direction \( A N \).
- The north direction is represented by the line \( A N \).
- The true bearing of \( P \) from \( A \) is the angle measured clockwise from the north direction to the line \( A P \).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify the reference direction:**
   - The north direction is given by the line \( A N \). By definition, the true bearing starts from this north direction and is measured clockwise.

2. **Determine the position of \( P \) relative to \( A \):**
   - The angle \( \angle P A N = 45^\circ \) indicates that the line \( A P \) is rotated \( 45^\circ \) counterclockwise from the north direction \( A N \).

3. **Convert the angle to true bearing:**
   - True bearing is measured clockwise from the north. Since \( \angle P A N = 45^\circ \) is counterclockwise, the equivalent clockwise angle is:
     \[
     360^\circ - 45^\circ = 315^\circ
     \]
   - Therefore, the true bearing of \( P \) from \( A \) is \( 315^\circ \).

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The true bearing of \( P \) from \( A \) is \( 315^\circ \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{315^\circ}\]
