QUESTION:
There is a curve goes through (-4,0), (0,2), and (4,0). The points at (-4,0) and (4,0) are both solid points. Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
1. The curve is a parabola that opens downward.
2. The curve passes through the points $(-4, 0)$, $(0, 2)$, and $(4, 0)$.
3. The points $(-4, 0)$ and $(4, 0)$ are marked as solid points, indicating they are part of the curve's domain.
4. The curve reaches its maximum height at $(0, 2)$, which is the vertex of the parabola.

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Points and Their Coordinates**:
   - Point $A$ lies at $(-4, 0)$.
   - Point $B$ lies at $(0, 2)$.
   - Point $C$ lies at $(4, 0)$.
2. **Points on the Curve**:
   - Points $A$, $B$, and $C$ all lie on the curve.
3. **Domain and Range**:
   - The domain of the function is given as $[-4, 4]$.
   - The range of the function is given as $[0, 2]$.

#### Key Observations:
- The curve is symmetric about the vertical line $x = 0$ (the y-axis).
- The function is defined for all $x$-values between $-4$ and $4$, inclusive.
- The function's output (y-values) ranges from $0$ to $2$, inclusive.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Confirm the Domain
- The domain is explicitly stated in the predicates as $[-4, 4]$.
- Visually, the curve starts at $x = -4$ and ends at $x = 4$, with no gaps in between.
- Since the points $(-4, 0)$ and $(4, 0)$ are included (solid points), the domain includes these endpoints.
- Therefore, the domain is $[-4, 4]$.

#### Step 2.2: Confirm the Range
- The range is explicitly stated in the predicates as $[0, 2]$.
- Visually, the highest point of the curve is at $(0, 2)$, and the lowest points are at $(-4, 0)$ and $(4, 0)$.
- The curve does not extend above $y = 2$ or below $y = 0$.
- Since the curve includes the points $(0, 2)$, $(-4, 0)$, and $(4, 0)$, the range includes these endpoints.
- Therefore, the range is $[0, 2]$.

#### Step 2.3: Combine Results
- The domain and range are consistent with both the visual representation and the given predicates.
- The domain is $[-4, 4]$ and the range is $[0, 2]$.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The domain and range of the function are clearly defined by the given information and visual cues. Combining the results from the deductions:

- **Domain**: $[-4, 4]$
- **Range**: $[0, 2]$

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{Domain: } [-4, 4], \quad \text{Range: } [0, 2]}
\]

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $\text{Domain: } [-4, 4], \quad \text{Range: } [0, 2]$
