### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Information from Predicates and Image:
1. **Points and Lines**:
   - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are given.
   - Lines \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) form a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).

2. **Angles**:
   - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(B, A, C)) = 49^\circ \).
   - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(A, B, C)) = 39^\circ \).
   - By the sum of angles in a triangle theorem:
     \[
     \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(A, C, B)) = 180^\circ - \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(B, A, C)) - \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(A, B, C)).
     \]
     Substituting the given values:
     \[
     \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(A, C, B)) = 180^\circ - 49^\circ - 39^\circ = 92^\circ.
     \]

3. **Bearing Information**:
   - Point \( B \) is due East of point \( A \). This means the direction from \( A \) to \( B \) is \( 90^\circ \) (measured clockwise from North).

#### Question:
We need to determine the **true bearing** of point \( A \) from point \( C \). True bearing is measured clockwise from North.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Analyze the Triangle \( \triangle ABC \)
From the predicates, we know:
- \( \angle BAC = 49^\circ \).
- \( \angle ABC = 39^\circ \).
- \( \angle ACB = 92^\circ \).

#### Step 2.2: Determine the Direction from \( C \) to \( A \)
To find the true bearing of point \( A \) from point \( C \), we need to determine the angle formed by the direction from \( C \) to \( A \) relative to North.

##### Visualizing the Bearings:
1. **Direction from \( A \) to \( B \)**:
   - Since \( B \) is due East of \( A \), the direction from \( A \) to \( B \) is \( 90^\circ \).

2. **Direction from \( C \) to \( B \)**:
   - The angle \( \angle ACB = 92^\circ \) is the internal angle at \( C \) in \( \triangle ABC \). To find the external angle at \( C \) that corresponds to the direction from \( C \) to \( B \), we use:
     \[
     \text{External angle at } C = 180^\circ - \angle ACB = 180^\circ - 92^\circ = 88^\circ.
     \]
   - This means the direction from \( C \) to \( B \) is \( 88^\circ \) clockwise from the direction from \( C \) to \( A \).

3. **Direction from \( C \) to \( A \)**:
   - The direction from \( C \) to \( A \) is the reference direction we need to determine. Since \( \angle BAC = 49^\circ \), the direction from \( A \) to \( C \) forms an angle of \( 49^\circ \) with the direction from \( A \) to \( B \).

##### Combining Directions:
- The direction from \( A \) to \( B \) is \( 90^\circ \) (due East).
- The direction from \( A \) to \( C \) is \( 90^\circ + 49^\circ = 139^\circ \) (measured clockwise from North).
- Therefore, the direction from \( C \) to \( A \) is the opposite direction, which is:
  \[
  139^\circ + 180^\circ = 319^\circ \quad (\text{since } 319^\circ \text{ is the true bearing from } C \text{ to } A).
  \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The true bearing of point \( A \) from point \( C \) is \( 319^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{319^\circ}
\]
