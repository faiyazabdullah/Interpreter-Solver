QUESTION:
Iainâ€™s car has run out of petrol. He walks 12 km west and then 9 km south looking for a petrol station.

If he is now $h$ km directly from his starting point, find the value of $h$.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Elements and Predicates:
- The image shows a right triangle with vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- The sides are labeled:
  - \( AB = 9 \) (vertical side),
  - \( BC = 12 \) (horizontal side),
  - \( AC = h \) (hypotenuse).
- The predicates confirm that:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( B \).
  - \( AB \) and \( BC \) are the legs of the triangle.
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.
  - The relationship \( h^2 = 9^2 + 12^2 \) holds by the Pythagorean theorem.

#### Key Relationships:
1. \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle.
2. \( AB = 9 \) and \( BC = 12 \) are the legs.
3. \( AC = h \) is the hypotenuse.
4. The problem involves finding \( h \), the direct distance from the starting point to the current position.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem
The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Mathematically:
\[
h^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
\]
Substitute the given lengths \( AB = 9 \) and \( BC = 12 \):
\[
h^2 = 9^2 + 12^2
\]

#### Step 2.2: Calculate the Squares
Calculate \( 9^2 \) and \( 12^2 \):
\[
9^2 = 81, \quad 12^2 = 144
\]
Thus:
\[
h^2 = 81 + 144
\]

#### Step 2.3: Sum the Squares
Add the values:
\[
h^2 = 225
\]

#### Step 2.4: Solve for \( h \)
Take the square root of both sides to solve for \( h \):
\[
h = \sqrt{225}
\]
\[
h = 15
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The value of \( h \) is the direct distance from Iain's starting point to his current position. Based on the deductions and calculations, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]
