QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, on the graph.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The image shows a circle centered at the origin \((0, 0)\).
- The circle intersects the \(x\)-axis and \(y\)-axis at four points.
- The center of the circle appears to lie at the origin \((0, 0)\).

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Predicates about the Circle and Center:**
   - `Circle(Circle1)` indicates there is a circle labeled \(Circle1\).
   - `Point(Center)` indicates there is a point labeled as the center.
   - `PointLiesOnCircle(Center, Circle1)` implies the center lies on the circle itself, but this is unusual for a standard circle. However, we will interpret it as the center being at the origin, which is consistent with the image.

2. **Predicates about Points on the Circle:**
   - `PointLiesOnCircle(Point1, Circle1)`, `PointLiesOnCircle(Point2, Circle1)`, `PointLiesOnCircle(Point3, Circle1)`, `PointLiesOnCircle(Point4, Circle1)` indicate there are four points on the circle.
   - These points likely correspond to the intersections of the circle with the axes.

3. **Predicates about Radii:**
   - `IsRadiusOf(Line1, Circle1)`, `IsRadiusOf(Line2, Circle1)`, `IsRadiusOf(Line3, Circle1)`, `IsRadiusOf(Line4, Circle1)` indicate there are four radii connecting the center to the points on the circle.
   - `PointLiesOnLine(Center, Line1)`, `PointLiesOnLine(Center, Line2)`, `PointLiesOnLine(Center, Line3)`, `PointLiesOnLine(Center, Line4)` confirm that the center lies on each radius.
   - `Equals(LengthOf(Line1), LengthOf(Line2))`, `Equals(LengthOf(Line2), LengthOf(Line3))`, `Equals(LengthOf(Line3), LengthOf(Line4))`, `Equals(LengthOf(Line4), LengthOf(Line1))` imply that all radii have the same length, which is the definition of a circle.

4. **Coordinates of Intersection Points:**
   - The circle intersects the axes at four points. Since the center is at the origin, these points must be symmetrically placed along the axes.
   - The intersections suggest that the circle's radius is the distance from the origin to any of these points.

#### Key Observations:
- The center of the circle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).
- The circle intersects the \(x\)-axis and \(y\)-axis, meaning its radius extends equally in all directions from the origin.
- The radius is the distance from the origin to any point of intersection with the axes.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Determine the Coordinates of Intersection Points
- From the image, the circle intersects the \(x\)-axis at two points: \((-r, 0)\) and \((r, 0)\).
- Similarly, it intersects the \(y\)-axis at two points: \((0, -r)\) and \((0, r)\).
- The radius \(r\) is the distance from the origin to any of these points.

#### Step 2.2: Use the Predicates to Confirm Symmetry
- The predicates confirm that the circle is symmetric about the origin, and all radii are equal in length.
- Since the circle intersects the axes, the radius \(r\) is the distance from the origin to any intersection point.

#### Step 2.3: Calculate the Radius
- From the image, observe that the circle intersects the \(x\)-axis at approximately \((5, 0)\) and \((-5, 0)\).
- Similarly, it intersects the \(y\)-axis at approximately \((0, 5)\) and \((0, -5)\).
- Therefore, the radius \(r\) is the distance from the origin to any of these points, which is \(5\).

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The radius of the circle is the distance from the origin to any point of intersection with the axes. Based on the image and the symmetry of the circle, the radius is \(5\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
