### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Observations from the Image:
1. The graph depicts a parabola (a quadratic function) that opens downward.
2. The vertex appears to be at approximately \( (-1, 2) \).
3. The function passes through the points \( (-2, 1) \), \( (-1, 2) \), and \( (0, 1) \).

#### Key Predicates:
- Points \( A(-2, 1) \), \( B(-1, 2) \), and \( C(0, 1) \) lie on the graph of the quadratic function \( f(x) \).

#### Task:
We need to determine the equation of the quadratic function \( f(x) \) that passes through the given points.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### General Form of a Quadratic Function:
A quadratic function can be written in the general form:
\[
f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
\]
where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are constants to be determined.

#### Substituting the Given Points:
We are given three points: \( A(-2, 1) \), \( B(-1, 2) \), and \( C(0, 1) \). Substituting these into the general form \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \):

1. **Point \( A(-2, 1) \):**
   \[
   f(-2) = a(-2)^2 + b(-2) + c = 1
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   4a - 2b + c = 1 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

2. **Point \( B(-1, 2) \):**
   \[
   f(-1) = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c = 2
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   a - b + c = 2 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

3. **Point \( C(0, 1) \):**
   \[
   f(0) = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = 1
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   c = 1 \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
   \]

#### Solving the System of Equations:
From Equation 3, we know:
\[
c = 1
\]

Substitute \( c = 1 \) into Equations 1 and 2:

1. **Equation 1:**
   \[
   4a - 2b + 1 = 1
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   4a - 2b = 0 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
   \]

2. **Equation 2:**
   \[
   a - b + 1 = 2
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   a - b = 1 \quad \text{(Equation 5)}
   \]

#### Solve the System of Linear Equations:
We now solve the system of equations:
\[
4a - 2b = 0 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]
\[
a - b = 1 \quad \text{(Equation 5)}
\]

From Equation 4:
\[
4a = 2b \implies 2a = b \quad \text{(Equation 6)}
\]

Substitute \( b = 2a \) into Equation 5:
\[
a - (2a) = 1
\]
\[
-a = 1 \implies a = -1
\]

Using \( a = -1 \) in Equation 6:
\[
b = 2a = 2(-1) = -2
\]

#### Determine the Coefficients:
We have:
\[
a = -1, \quad b = -2, \quad c = 1
\]

#### Write the Quadratic Function:
Substitute \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) into the general form \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \):
\[
f(x) = -x^2 - 2x + 1
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The quadratic function that passes through the points \( (-2, 1) \), \( (-1, 2) \), and \( (0, 1) \) is:
\[
f(x) = -x^2 - 2x + 1
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{-x^2 - 2x + 1}
\]
