QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 3.3\right)$, and it has a maximum point at $(-2 \pi, 9.8)$. What is the amplitude of the function?

### Problem Analysis:
We are given a trigonometric function whose graph is shown in the image. The function intersects its midline at the point $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\pi, 3.3\right)$ and has a maximum point at $(-2\pi, 9.8)$. We need to determine the amplitude of the function.

#### Key Observations from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Midline Intersection Point**: The function intersects its midline at $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\pi, 3.3\right)$. This means the midline of the function is the horizontal line $y = 3.3$.
2. **Maximum Point**: The function reaches its maximum value at $(-2\pi, 9.8)$. The y-coordinate of this point is $9.8$.
3. **Amplitude Definition**: The amplitude of a trigonometric function is half the distance between its maximum value and its minimum value. Since the midline is the average of the maximum and minimum values, the amplitude is the vertical distance from the midline to either the maximum or minimum value.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### **Step 1: Identify the Midline**
- The midline is given by the y-coordinate of the intersection point with the midline, which is $y = 3.3$.

#### **Step 2: Determine the Maximum Value**
- The maximum value of the function is the y-coordinate of the maximum point, which is $9.8$.

#### **Step 3: Calculate the Amplitude**
- The amplitude is the vertical distance from the midline to the maximum value. This distance is:
  \[
  \text{Amplitude} = \text{Maximum Value} - \text{Midline}
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  \text{Amplitude} = 9.8 - 3.3 = 6.5
  \]

### Conclusion:
The amplitude of the function is the distance from the midline to the maximum value, which we have calculated to be $6.5$.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{6.5}\]
