QUESTION:
Peter received a lump sum payment of $\$ 50000$ for an insurance claim (and decided not to put it in a savings account).

Every month, he withdraws $5 \%$ of the remaining funds.

The funds after $x$ months is shown below. The curve in the graph passes (0,5). y-axis labels"y('0000s)"

How much would the first withdrawal be?

FINAL RESPONSE:

```python
To solve the problem systematically, let's analyze the given information and derive the final answer step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Image and Identify Key Elements

From the image, I observe the graph and note the following:

- The graph shows a straight line passing through points labeled $(20, 5)$
- There's no explicit mention of a specific geometric shape or construction
- The graph appears to be a Cartesian coordinate system with a point at $(20, 5)$

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

Given the point \((20, 5)\):

1. **Step 1:** Since the point \((20, 5)\) lies on the graph
- By **Definition of Point**, this indicates a specific location in the Cartesian plane

2. **Step 2:** The x-coordinate is \(x = 20\), and the y-coordinate is \(y = 5\)

### Deductive Reasoning:

- From **Cartesian Coordinates Theorem**, these represent fixed distances on axes
- The \(x\)-coordinate is the horizontal position, and the \(y\)-coordinate is the vertical position

### Final Answer: \[\boxed{(20, 5}\]

This concludes my analysis with the boxed coordinate in proper format.
