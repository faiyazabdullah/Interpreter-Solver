FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
1. The graph depicts a parabola that opens upwards.
2. The vertex of the parabola is located at the point \((2, -2)\).
3. The parabola is symmetric about the vertical line \(x = 2\).
4. Points \((0, 3)\) and \((4, 3)\) lie on the parabola.
5. The parabola is decreasing to the left of the vertex and increasing to the right of the vertex.

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Point(Vertex)**: The vertex is a specific point.
2. **Equals(2,-2,Vertex)**: The vertex is located at \((2, -2)\).
3. **Shape(Parabola)**: The geometric figure is a parabola.
4. **IsVertexOf(Vertex,Parabola)**: The vertex \((2, -2)\) belongs to the parabola.
5. **Symmetric(Parabola,Line(x,2))**: The parabola is symmetric about the line \(x = 2\).
6. **PointLiesOnLine(Vertex,Line(x,2))**: The vertex lies on the line \(x = 2\).
7. **PointLiesOnShape(Point(0,3),Parabola)**: The point \((0, 3)\) lies on the parabola.
8. **PointLiesOnShape(Point(4,3),Parabola)**: The point \((4, 3)\) lies on the parabola.
9. **Decreasing(Parabola,Interval(NegativeInfinity,2))**: The parabola is decreasing on the interval \((-∞, 2)\).
10. **Increasing(Parabola,Interval(2,PositiveInfinity))**: The parabola is increasing on the interval \((2, ∞)\).

#### Key Observations:
- The parabola opens upwards because it increases to the right of its vertex.
- The vertex is at \((2, -2)\), and the parabola is symmetric about the vertical line \(x = 2\).
- The parabola is decreasing to the left of \(x = 2\) and increasing to the right of \(x = 2\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the Vertex and Symmetry
- From the predicate **Equals(2,-2,Vertex)** and the image, the vertex of the parabola is \((2, -2)\).
- By **Symmetric(Parabola,Line(x,2))**, the parabola is symmetric about the line \(x = 2\). This means that for every point \((x, y)\) on the parabola, there is a corresponding point \((4 - x, y)\) also on the parabola.

#### Step 2.2: Determine Increasing and Decreasing Intervals
- The predicate **Decreasing(Parabola,Interval(NegativeInfinity,2))** states that the parabola is decreasing on the interval \((-∞, 2)\). This means that as \(x\) increases in this interval, the value of \(y\) decreases.
- The predicate **Increasing(Parabola,Interval(2,PositiveInfinity))** states that the parabola is increasing on the interval \((2, ∞)\). This means that as \(x\) increases in this interval, the value of \(y\) increases.
- Since the vertex is at \((2, -2)\), the parabola reaches its minimum value at this point. Therefore, the function is constant only at the vertex itself.

#### Step 2.3: Verify with Additional Points
- The points \((0, 3)\) and \((4, 3)\) lie on the parabola. These points confirm the symmetry about \(x = 2\) because they are equidistant from the vertex and have the same \(y\)-coordinate.
- The fact that the parabola opens upwards aligns with the given intervals of increase and decrease.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

From the above deductions, we can conclude:
- The parabola is decreasing on the interval \((-∞, 2)\).
- The parabola is increasing on the interval \((2, ∞)\).
- The parabola is constant only at the vertex \((2, -2)\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{Decreasing on } (-∞, 2), \text{ Increasing on } (2, ∞), \text{ Constant at } x = 2}
\]
