QUESTION:
In the figure above. The graph consists of four lines l,m,n,p intersecting each other. Line l and line p are perpendicular. If the angle (not shown) where lines n and p intersect is twice as large as the angle (also not shown) where lines l and m intersect, what is the value of x?

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual and Predicate Analysis:
1. **Lines and Points**:
   - Lines \( l \), \( m \), \( n \), and \( p \) intersect at various points.
   - Points \( l \), \( m \), \( n \), and \( p \) lie on their respective lines.
   - Intersection points are labeled such that lines \( l \) and \( p \) meet at a right angle (\( 90^\circ \)).

2. **Angles**:
   - The angle between lines \( l \) and \( p \) is \( 90^\circ \).
   - The angle between lines \( n \) and \( p \) is \( 110^\circ \).
   - The angle \( x \) is formed between lines \( l \) and \( m \).

3. **Key Relationships**:
   - Line \( l \) is perpendicular to line \( p \).
   - The problem states that the angle where lines \( n \) and \( p \) intersect is twice the angle where lines \( l \) and \( m \) intersect.

#### Specific Goal:
We need to determine the value of \( x \), the angle formed between lines \( l \) and \( m \).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Analyze Perpendicularity
- From the predicate **Perpendicular(Line(l), Line(p))**, we know:
  \[
  \text{Angle between } l \text{ and } p = 90^\circ.
  \]

#### Step 2.2: Analyze the Angle Between \( n \) and \( p \)
- The problem states that the angle where lines \( n \) and \( p \) intersect is \( 110^\circ \). This means:
  \[
  \text{Angle between } n \text{ and } p = 110^\circ.
  \]

#### Step 2.3: Relate the Angles Using the Problem Statement
- The problem states that the angle where lines \( n \) and \( p \) intersect is twice the angle where lines \( l \) and \( m \) intersect. Let the angle where lines \( l \) and \( m \) intersect be \( x \). Then:
  \[
  \text{Angle between } n \text{ and } p = 2 \cdot \text{Angle between } l \text{ and } m.
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  110^\circ = 2x.
  \]

#### Step 2.4: Solve for \( x \)
- Solving the equation \( 110^\circ = 2x \):
  \[
  x = \frac{110^\circ}{2} = 55^\circ.
  \]

#### Step 2.5: Verify the Solution
- The angle \( x \) is the angle between lines \( l \) and \( m \). Since the problem's conditions are satisfied (the angle between \( n \) and \( p \) is indeed twice the angle between \( l \) and \( m \)), the solution is consistent.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The value of \( x \) is \( 55^\circ \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{55^\circ}\]
