### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the surface area of a solid composed of two identical boxes and a cylinder positioned between them. Here's a systematic breakdown:

#### **Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**
1. **Shapes Involved**:
   - Two identical boxes labeled as `box1` and `box2`.
   - A cylinder positioned between the two boxes.

2. **Dimensions Provided**:
   - Box dimensions: Length = 25, Width = 20, Height = 33.
   - Cylinder dimensions: Radius = 6, Height = 11.

3. **Key Relationships**:
   - The boxes are congruent (`Congruent(box1, box2)`).
   - The cylinder fits snugly between the two boxes, meaning its height matches the gap between the boxes, which is 11.

4. **Surface Area Components**:
   - Surface area of the two boxes.
   - Surface area of the cylinder.
   - Adjustments for overlapping regions (where the cylinder touches the boxes).

#### **Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

##### **Part 1: Surface Area of One Box**
The surface area of a rectangular prism is given by:
\[
\text{Surface Area of one box} = 2(lw + lh + wh)
\]
where \( l = 25 \), \( w = 20 \), and \( h = 33 \). Substituting these values:
\[
\text{Surface Area of one box} = 2(25 \cdot 20 + 25 \cdot 33 + 20 \cdot 33)
\]
\[
= 2(500 + 825 + 660)
\]
\[
= 2(1985) = 3970
\]
Since there are two identical boxes, the total surface area of the boxes is:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area of Boxes} = 2 \times 3970 = 7940
\]

##### **Part 2: Surface Area of the Cylinder**
The surface area of a cylinder consists of:
1. The lateral surface area.
2. The areas of the two circular bases.

However, since the cylinder is embedded between the two boxes, only the lateral surface area of the cylinder contributes to the total surface area of the solid. The lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area of Cylinder} = 2\pi rh
\]
where \( r = 6 \) and \( h = 11 \). Substituting these values:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area of Cylinder} = 2\pi (6)(11) = 132\pi
\]

##### **Part 3: Adjusting for Overlapping Regions**
The cylinder is embedded between the two boxes, so the circular bases of the cylinder do not contribute to the external surface area. However, the circular regions where the cylinder touches the boxes must be subtracted from the surface area of the boxes. Each circular region has an area of:
\[
\text{Area of one circular base} = \pi r^2 = \pi (6)^2 = 36\pi
\]
Since the cylinder touches two faces of the boxes, we subtract the area of two circular bases from the total surface area of the boxes:
\[
\text{Adjustment for Overlapping Regions} = 2 \times 36\pi = 72\pi
\]

##### **Part 4: Total Surface Area of the Solid**
The total surface area of the solid is the sum of the surface areas of the two boxes and the lateral surface area of the cylinder, minus the overlapping regions:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Total Surface Area of Boxes} + \text{Lateral Surface Area of Cylinder} - \text{Adjustment for Overlapping Regions}
\]
\[
= 7940 + 132\pi - 72\pi
\]
\[
= 7940 + 60\pi
\]

##### **Numerical Calculation**
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
60\pi \approx 60 \times 3.14159 = 188.4954
\]
Thus:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 7940 + 188.4954 = 8128.4954
\]
Rounding to two decimal places:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 8128.50
\]

#### **Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8128.50}
\]
