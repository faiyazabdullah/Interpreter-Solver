### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information:
- The image shows a straight line segment on a Cartesian coordinate plane.
- The endpoints of the line segment are labeled as points \( A \) and \( B \).
- The coordinates of point \( A \) appear to be approximately \((-3, 4)\).
- The coordinates of point \( B \) appear to be approximately \((5, 2)\).

#### Formal Predicates:
1. **Point(A)**: Point \( A \) exists.
2. **Point(B)**: Point \( B \) exists.
3. **Line(A,B)**: A line is defined between points \( A \) and \( B \).
4. **PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(A,B))**: Point \( A \) lies on the line passing through \( A \) and \( B \).
5. **PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,B))**: Point \( B \) lies on the line passing through \( A \) and \( B \).
6. **Equals(A,(-3,4))**: The coordinates of point \( A \) are \((-3, 4)\).
7. **Equals(B,(5,2))**: The coordinates of point \( B \) are \((5, 2)\).

#### Key Measurements and Relationships:
- The endpoints of the line segment are given as \( A = (-3, 4) \) and \( B = (5, 2) \).
- The task is to calculate the distance between these two points using the distance formula.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Distance Formula:
The distance \( d \) between two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) in the Cartesian plane is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

#### Substituting Coordinates:
From the predicates, we know:
- \( A = (-3, 4) \): \( x_1 = -3 \) and \( y_1 = 4 \).
- \( B = (5, 2) \): \( x_2 = 5 \) and \( y_2 = 2 \).

Substitute these coordinates into the distance formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{(5 - (-3))^2 + (2 - 4)^2}
\]

#### Simplify Expressions:
1. Calculate \( x_2 - x_1 \):
\[
x_2 - x_1 = 5 - (-3) = 5 + 3 = 8
\]

2. Calculate \( y_2 - y_1 \):
\[
y_2 - y_1 = 2 - 4 = -2
\]

3. Square the differences:
\[
(5 - (-3))^2 = 8^2 = 64
\]
\[
(2 - 4)^2 = (-2)^2 = 4
\]

4. Add the squared differences:
\[
64 + 4 = 68
\]

5. Take the square root:
\[
d = \sqrt{68}
\]

#### Approximation:
Using a calculator, we find:
\[
\sqrt{68} \approx 8.246
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The distance between the two endpoints \( A = (-3, 4) \) and \( B = (5, 2) \) is approximately \( 8.246 \) when rounded to three decimal places.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{8.246}
\]
