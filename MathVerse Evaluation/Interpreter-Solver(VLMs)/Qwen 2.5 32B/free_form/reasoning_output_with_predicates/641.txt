QUESTION:
The figure shows a cylinder with height of 8 centimeters and radius of 6 centimeters. The volume of a cylinder is given by $V=\pi r^2h$. 

Find the volume of the cylinder, rounding your answer to two decimal places.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Analysis:
- The image depicts a cylinder.
- The radius of the cylinder is labeled as \(6 \, \text{cm}\).
- The height of the cylinder is labeled as \(8 \, \text{cm}\).

#### Predicate Analysis:
- From the given predicates:
  - Shape(Cylinder): The figure is a cylinder.
  - RadiusOf(Cylinder): The radius of the cylinder is denoted as \( \text{RadiusOf(Cylinder)} \).
  - HeightOf(Cylinder): The height of the cylinder is denoted as \( \text{HeightOf(Cylinder)} \).
  - Equals(RadiusOf(Cylinder), 6): The radius of the cylinder is \(6 \, \text{cm}\).
  - Equals(HeightOf(Cylinder), 8): The height of the cylinder is \(8 \, \text{cm}\).

#### Key Measurements:
- Radius (\(r\)): \(6 \, \text{cm}\)
- Height (\(h\)): \(8 \, \text{cm}\)

#### Goal:
The problem asks us to calculate the volume of the cylinder using the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify Known Values
From the image and predicates:
- Radius (\(r\)) = \(6 \, \text{cm}\)
- Height (\(h\)) = \(8 \, \text{cm}\)

#### Step 2.2: Apply the Volume Formula
The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

Substitute the known values into the formula:
\[ V = \pi (6)^2 (8) \]

#### Step 2.3: Simplify the Expression
First, calculate \(r^2\):
\[ r^2 = 6^2 = 36 \]

Now substitute \(r^2\) back into the formula:
\[ V = \pi (36)(8) \]

Next, calculate \(36 \times 8\):
\[ 36 \times 8 = 288 \]

Thus:
\[ V = 288\pi \]

#### Step 2.4: Approximate the Volume
To find the numerical value, use the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
\[ V \approx 288 \times 3.14159 \]

Perform the multiplication:
\[ V \approx 904.77872 \]

Round the result to two decimal places:
\[ V \approx 904.78 \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The volume of the cylinder is:
\[ V = 904.78 \, \text{cm}^3 \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{904.78 \, \text{cm}^3}
\]
