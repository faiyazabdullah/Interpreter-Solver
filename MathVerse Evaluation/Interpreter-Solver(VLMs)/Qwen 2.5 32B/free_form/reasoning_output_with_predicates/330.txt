QUESTION:
A rally car starts at point P and races 191 kilometres south to point Q. Here the car turns west and races for 83 kilometres to point R. At point R the car must turn to head directly back to point P.

What is the compass bearing of R from P? Give your answer to one decimal place.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual and Predicate Analysis:
1. **Points and Lines**:
   - Points \( P \), \( Q \), and \( R \) are given.
   - Line segments \( PQ \), \( QR \), and \( RP \) form a right triangle \( \triangle PQR \).
   - \( PQ \) is vertical (south direction), and \( QR \) is horizontal (west direction).

2. **Measurements**:
   - \( \text{LengthOf}(PQ) = 191 \) km.
   - \( \text{LengthOf}(QR) = 83 \) km.
   - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(P, Q, R)) = 90^\circ \).

3. **Key Angles**:
   - \( \angle PQR = 90^\circ \) (right angle).
   - We need to determine the compass bearing of \( R \) from \( P \). This requires finding the angle \( \alpha \) that the line segment \( PR \) makes with the north direction.

4. **Objective**:
   - Determine the compass bearing of \( R \) from \( P \). The compass bearing will be measured clockwise from the north direction.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the Triangle Configuration
From the given information:
- \( \triangle PQR \) is a right triangle with \( \angle PQR = 90^\circ \).
- \( PQ \) is the vertical leg (south direction), and \( QR \) is the horizontal leg (west direction).

#### Step 2.2: Use Trigonometry to Find \( \alpha \)
The angle \( \alpha \) is the angle between the line segment \( PR \) and the north direction. To find \( \alpha \):
1. **Calculate the length of \( PR \)** using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   PR = \sqrt{PQ^2 + QR^2} = \sqrt{191^2 + 83^2}
   \]
   \[
   PR = \sqrt{36481 + 6889} = \sqrt{43370} \approx 208.26 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Determine \( \alpha \)** using trigonometry. The angle \( \alpha \) is the angle between \( PR \) and the north direction. In the right triangle \( \triangle PQR \):
   - \( \tan(\alpha) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{QR}{PQ} = \frac{83}{191} \).
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \alpha = \arctan\left(\frac{83}{191}\right)
     \]
   - Using a calculator:
     \[
     \alpha \approx \arctan(0.434555) \approx 23.5^\circ
     \]

#### Step 2.3: Determine the Compass Bearing
The compass bearing of \( R \) from \( P \) is measured clockwise from the north direction. Since \( R \) is located west of \( P \) and slightly south, the compass bearing is:
\[
270^\circ + \alpha = 270^\circ + 23.5^\circ = 293.5^\circ
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The compass bearing of \( R \) from \( P \) is \( 293.5^\circ \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{293.5^\circ}\]
