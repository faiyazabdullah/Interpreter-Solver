QUESTION:
The final approach of an aeroplane when landing requires the pilot to adjust their angle of descent to about 3Â°. If the plane is 12 metres above the runway and has d metres until touchdown, find d to the nearest metre.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the horizontal distance \( d \) that an airplane travels before touchdown, given that it is descending at an angle of \( 3^\circ \) and is 12 meters above the runway. The geometry of the situation can be modeled as a right triangle, where:
- The vertical height (opposite side) is 12 meters.
- The horizontal distance (adjacent side) is \( d \) meters.
- The angle of descent is \( 3^\circ \).

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and predicates:
1. The airplane is at a height of 12 meters above the runway.
2. The angle of descent is \( 3^\circ \).
3. The horizontal distance to touchdown is \( d \) meters.
4. This forms a right triangle with:
   - One leg as the height (12 meters),
   - The other leg as the horizontal distance \( d \),
   - The hypotenuse as the flight path.
5. We need to find \( d \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Identify the relevant trigonometric relationship
In a right triangle, the tangent of an angle is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side:
\[
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
\]
Here, the angle \( \theta = 3^\circ \), the opposite side is the height (12 meters), and the adjacent side is the horizontal distance \( d \). Therefore:
\[
\tan(3^\circ) = \frac{12}{d}
\]

#### Step 2.2: Solve for \( d \)
Rearrange the equation to solve for \( d \):
\[
d = \frac{12}{\tan(3^\circ)}
\]

#### Step 2.3: Calculate \( \tan(3^\circ) \)
Using a calculator to find \( \tan(3^\circ) \):
\[
\tan(3^\circ) \approx 0.0524
\]

#### Step 2.4: Substitute and compute \( d \)
Substitute \( \tan(3^\circ) \approx 0.0524 \) into the equation:
\[
d = \frac{12}{0.0524} \approx 229.01
\]

#### Step 2.5: Round to the nearest meter
The problem asks for the value of \( d \) to the nearest meter. Rounding 229.01 to the nearest whole number gives:
\[
d \approx 229
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion
The horizontal distance \( d \) until touchdown is approximately 229 meters.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{229}
\]
