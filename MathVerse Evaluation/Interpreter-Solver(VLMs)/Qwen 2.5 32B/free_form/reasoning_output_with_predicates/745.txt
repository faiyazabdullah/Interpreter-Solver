QUESTION:
A soft drink can has a height of 13 cm and a radius of 3 cm. Find L, the length of the longest straw that can fit into the can (so that the straw is not bent and fits entirely inside the can).

Give your answer rounded down to the nearest cm, to ensure it fits inside the can.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image and Predicates:
1. **Circle(1)**: There is a circle labeled as Circle(1).
2. **HeightOf(1,13)**: The height of the cylinder (which contains the circle) is 13 cm.
3. **DiameterOf(1,3)**: The diameter of the circle is 3 cm, so the radius is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) cm.
4. **Line(A,B)**: This line represents the height of the cylinder, with a length of 13 cm.
5. **Line(C,D)**: This line represents the diameter of the circle, with a length of 3 cm.
6. **Triangle(A,B,E)**: A right triangle is formed where:
   - Line(A,B) is one side (vertical height of the cylinder).
   - Line(B,E) is another side (horizontal diameter of the circle).
   - Line(A,E) is the hypotenuse, which is the longest straw that fits inside the can.
7. **RightAngle(Angle(A,B,E))**: The angle at B is a right angle, making Triangle(A,B,E) a right triangle.
8. **LengthOf(Line(A,E),L)**: The length of the hypotenuse Line(A,E) is denoted as \( L \).
9. **Equals(Pow(L,2),SumOf(Pow(13,2),Pow(3,2)))**: By the Pythagorean theorem, \( L^2 = 13^2 + 3^2 \).

#### Key Measurements and Relationships:
- The height of the cylinder (Line(A,B)) is 13 cm.
- The diameter of the circular base (Line(C,D)) is 3 cm.
- The longest straw that fits inside the can corresponds to the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the height and the diameter.

#### Specific Value Asked:
We need to find \( L \), the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle, and round it down to the nearest integer.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem
The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Here:
- One side is the height of the cylinder, \( AB = 13 \) cm.
- The other side is the diameter of the circular base, \( BE = 3 \) cm.
- The hypotenuse is \( AE = L \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
L^2 = 13^2 + 3^2
\]

Calculate the squares:
\[
13^2 = 169, \quad 3^2 = 9
\]

Add the squares:
\[
L^2 = 169 + 9 = 178
\]

Take the square root to find \( L \):
\[
L = \sqrt{178}
\]

#### Step 2.2: Approximate \( \sqrt{178} \)
Using a calculator:
\[
\sqrt{178} \approx 13.34166
\]

#### Step 2.3: Round Down to the Nearest Integer
The problem specifies rounding down to the nearest integer. Therefore:
\[
L \approx 13
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The length of the longest straw that can fit into the can, rounded down to the nearest integer, is \( 13 \) cm.

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]
