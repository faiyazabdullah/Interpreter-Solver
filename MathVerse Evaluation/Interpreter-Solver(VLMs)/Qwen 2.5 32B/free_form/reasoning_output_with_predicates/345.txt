QUESTION:
Luke sailed for 116 kilometres on a bearing of 231^\circ .

If w is how many kilometres west he has sailed from his starting point, find $w$ to one decimal place.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Observations from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Lines and Points**:
   - Line \( O, N \) is vertical.
   - Line \( O, W \) is horizontal.
   - Line \( O, S \) is a line representing the sailing path.
   - Point \( O \) is the origin.
   - Point \( SailingEnd \) is the endpoint of the sailing path.

2. **Angles**:
   - \( \angle N, O, SailingEnd = 231^\circ \).
   - \( \angle W, SailingEnd, Vertical \) is a right angle (90°).

3. **Lengths**:
   - The length of \( Line(O, SailingEnd) = 116 \) km.
   - We need to find \( w \), the distance from \( O \) to \( W \) along the horizontal line.

4. **Geometric Relationships**:
   - The sailing path forms a triangle \( \triangle O, W, SailingEnd \).
   - \( \angle O, W, SailingEnd \) is a right angle.
   - The angle \( \angle N, O, SailingEnd \) is given as 231°, which helps us determine the direction of the sailing path relative to the cardinal directions.

#### Specific Goal:
We need to calculate \( w \), the horizontal distance westward from the starting point \( O \) to the point directly south of the sailing endpoint \( SailingEnd \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understanding the Direction of the Sailing Path
- The angle \( \angle N, O, SailingEnd = 231^\circ \) indicates the direction of the sailing path relative to the north direction.
- Since the compass direction starts from the north and rotates clockwise:
  - \( 231^\circ \) is located in the third quadrant (southwest direction).
  - To find the angle with respect to the west direction, subtract \( 180^\circ \):
    \[
    \angle \text{from west} = 231^\circ - 180^\circ = 51^\circ.
    \]
  - This means the sailing path makes a \( 51^\circ \) angle with the west direction.

#### Step 2.2: Using Trigonometry in the Right Triangle
- In the right triangle \( \triangle O, W, SailingEnd \):
  - The hypotenuse is the sailing path \( Line(O, SailingEnd) = 116 \) km.
  - The side adjacent to the \( 51^\circ \) angle is the horizontal distance \( w \).
  - The side opposite the \( 51^\circ \) angle is the vertical distance southward.

- By trigonometric definitions:
  \[
  \cos(51^\circ) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{w}{116}.
  \]
  Solving for \( w \):
  \[
  w = 116 \cdot \cos(51^\circ).
  \]

#### Step 2.3: Calculating \( w \)
- Using a calculator to find \( \cos(51^\circ) \):
  \[
  \cos(51^\circ) \approx 0.6293.
  \]
- Substituting into the equation:
  \[
  w = 116 \cdot 0.6293 \approx 73.1.
  \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The value of \( w \) is approximately \( 73.1 \) km. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{73.1}
\]
