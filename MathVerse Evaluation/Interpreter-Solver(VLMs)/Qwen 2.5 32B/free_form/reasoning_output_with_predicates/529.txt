QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function with a yellow point labeled ($-\frac{\pi}{3},2). It has a maximum point at $\left(-\frac{\pi}{3}, 2\right)$ and an amplitude of 1.8 . What is the midline equation of the function?

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph depicts a sinusoidal function.
- The maximum point is labeled at $\left(-\frac{\pi}{3}, 2\right)$.
- The amplitude of the function is given as 1.8.
- The midline is the horizontal line around which the function oscillates.

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Point(A)**: A is a point.
2. **PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(x, y))**: Point A lies on the graph of the function.
3. **Equals(A, (-\pi/3, 2))**: Point A is located at $\left(-\frac{\pi}{3}, 2\right)$.
4. **AmplitudeOf(f)**: The amplitude of the function is 1.8.
5. **MaximumOf(f, A)**: The maximum point of the function is at point A.

#### Key Observations:
- The maximum point of the function is at $\left(-\frac{\pi}{3}, 2\right)$.
- The amplitude of the function is 1.8.
- The midline is the horizontal line that is equidistant from the maximum and minimum points of the function.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understanding the Midline
The midline of a sinusoidal function is the horizontal line that runs through the middle of the oscillation. For a sinusoidal function of the form:
\[ f(x) = A \sin(Bx - C) + D \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amplitude,
- \( D \) is the vertical shift (which determines the midline).

The midline is given by the equation:
\[ y = D \]

#### Step 2.2: Relating the Midline to the Maximum Point
The maximum value of the function occurs when the sine function reaches its peak value of 1. At this point, the function value is:
\[ f(x) = A + D \]
Given that the maximum point is at $\left(-\frac{\pi}{3}, 2\right)$, we have:
\[ A + D = 2 \]

#### Step 2.3: Using the Amplitude
The amplitude \( A \) is given as 1.8. Substituting this into the equation:
\[ 1.8 + D = 2 \]

#### Step 2.4: Solving for \( D \)
Rearranging the equation to solve for \( D \):
\[ D = 2 - 1.8 \]
\[ D = 0.2 \]

#### Step 2.5: Determining the Midline
The midline is the horizontal line \( y = D \). Therefore, the midline equation is:
\[ y = 0.2 \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The midline of the function is the horizontal line \( y = 0.2 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{y = 0.2}
\]
