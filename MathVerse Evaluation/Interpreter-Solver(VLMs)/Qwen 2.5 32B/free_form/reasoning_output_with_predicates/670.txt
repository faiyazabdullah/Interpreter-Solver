QUESTION:
A solid consists of a cylinder (of radius 5mm and height 11mm) attached to a rectangular prism on one of its faces. The rectangular prism has sides of length 21mm, 10mm and 65mm. We wish to find the surface area of the entire solid. Note that an area is called 'exposed' if it is not covered by the other object.
What is the exposed surface area of the rectangular prism? Give your answer correct to two decimal places.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Observations from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Rectangular Prism**:
   - Dimensions: \(65 \, \text{mm} \times 21 \, \text{mm} \times 10 \, \text{mm}\).
   - One face of the rectangular prism (specifically the top face) is used to attach the cylinder.
   - The dimensions of the top face of the rectangular prism are \(65 \, \text{mm} \times 21 \, \text{mm}\).

2. **Cylinder**:
   - Radius: \(5 \, \text{mm}\).
   - Height: \(11 \, \text{mm}\).
   - The base of the cylinder is circular and is attached to the top face of the rectangular prism.

3. **Exposed Surface Area**:
   - The problem asks for the **exposed surface area** of the rectangular prism.
   - Exposed surface area means the total surface area of the rectangular prism minus the area of the face that is covered by the cylinder.

#### Key Measurements:
- Rectangular prism dimensions: \(65 \, \text{mm} \times 21 \, \text{mm} \times 10 \, \text{mm}\).
- Cylinder radius: \(5 \, \text{mm}\).
- Cylinder height: \(11 \, \text{mm}\).

#### Specific Value Requested:
- The exposed surface area of the rectangular prism.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### **Step 2.1: Calculate the Total Surface Area of the Rectangular Prism**
The formula for the surface area of a rectangular prism is:
\[
\text{Surface Area} = 2 \left( \text{Length} \cdot \text{Width} + \text{Width} \cdot \text{Height} + \text{Height} \cdot \text{Length} \right)
\]
Substitute the given dimensions:
\[
\text{Length} = 65 \, \text{mm}, \quad \text{Width} = 21 \, \text{mm}, \quad \text{Height} = 10 \, \text{mm}
\]
\[
\text{Surface Area} = 2 \left( 65 \cdot 21 + 21 \cdot 10 + 10 \cdot 65 \right)
\]
Calculate each term:
\[
65 \cdot 21 = 1365, \quad 21 \cdot 10 = 210, \quad 10 \cdot 65 = 650
\]
\[
\text{Surface Area} = 2 \left( 1365 + 210 + 650 \right) = 2 \cdot 2225 = 4450 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

#### **Step 2.2: Determine the Area of the Face Covered by the Cylinder**
The cylinder is attached to the top face of the rectangular prism, which has dimensions \(65 \, \text{mm} \times 21 \, \text{mm}\). However, only the circular base of the cylinder covers a portion of this face.

The area of the circular base of the cylinder is:
\[
\text{Area of Circle} = \pi r^2
\]
where \(r = 5 \, \text{mm}\):
\[
\text{Area of Circle} = \pi \cdot 5^2 = 25\pi \, \text{mm}^2
\]

#### **Step 2.3: Calculate the Exposed Surface Area of the Rectangular Prism**
The exposed surface area is the total surface area of the rectangular prism minus the area of the circular base of the cylinder. However, since the cylinder is attached to the top face, we only subtract the area of the circle from the top face of the prism.

The top face of the rectangular prism has an area of:
\[
\text{Top Face Area} = 65 \cdot 21 = 1365 \, \text{mm}^2
\]
The exposed area of the top face is:
\[
\text{Exposed Top Face Area} = 1365 - 25\pi \, \text{mm}^2
\]

The remaining surfaces of the rectangular prism (four sides and the bottom face) are completely exposed. Their total area is:
\[
\text{Remaining Surface Area} = 4450 - 2 \cdot 1365 = 4450 - 2730 = 1720 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

Thus, the total exposed surface area of the rectangular prism is:
\[
\text{Exposed Surface Area} = 1720 + (1365 - 25\pi) = 3085 - 25\pi \, \text{mm}^2
\]

#### **Step 2.4: Numerical Calculation**
Using \(\pi \approx 3.1416\):
\[
25\pi \approx 25 \cdot 3.1416 = 78.54 \, \text{mm}^2
\]
\[
\text{Exposed Surface Area} \approx 3085 - 78.54 = 3006.46 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The exposed surface area of the rectangular prism is:
\[
\boxed{3006.46 \, \text{mm}^2}
\]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{3006.46}\]
