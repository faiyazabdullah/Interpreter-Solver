### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual and Predicate Analysis:
1. **Geometric Figure Description**:
   - The figure consists of a **hemisphere** on top and a **cylinder** below it.
   - The diameter of the circular base is given as \( 10.5 \, \text{mm} \).
   - The height of the cylinder is given as \( 33.1 \, \text{mm} \).

2. **Key Predicates**:
   - **Circle(1)**: Represents the circular base of the cylinder and hemisphere.
   - **Shape(2)**: Represents the overall shape (hemisphere + cylinder).
   - **IsRadiusOf(Line(A,B), Circle(1))**: Indicates that the line segment \( AB \) is the radius of the circle.
   - **LengthOf(Line(A,B), 5.25)**: The length of the radius is \( 5.25 \, \text{mm} \).
   - **HeightOf(Shape(2), 33.1)**: The height of the cylindrical part is \( 33.1 \, \text{mm} \).
   - **DiameterOf(Circle(1), 10.5)**: The diameter of the circle is \( 10.5 \, \text{mm} \).
   - **Equals(Div(10.5, 2), 5.25)**: Confirms that the radius is half the diameter, i.e., \( 5.25 \, \text{mm} \).

3. **Question Requirements**:
   - We need to find the **total surface area** of the shape, which includes:
     - The curved surface area of the hemisphere.
     - The curved surface area of the cylinder.
     - The base area of the cylinder (since the hemisphere covers the top).

4. **Given Data**:
   - Radius \( r = 5.25 \, \text{mm} \).
   - Height of the cylinder \( h = 33.1 \, \text{mm} \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Surface Area of the Hemisphere
The surface area of a hemisphere (excluding the base) is given by:
\[
\text{Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2\pi r^2
\]
Substituting \( r = 5.25 \, \text{mm} \):
\[
\text{Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2\pi (5.25)^2 = 2\pi (27.5625) = 55.125\pi \, \text{mm}^2
\]

#### Step 2.2: Curved Surface Area of the Cylinder
The curved surface area of a cylinder is given by:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Cylinder} = 2\pi rh
\]
Substituting \( r = 5.25 \, \text{mm} \) and \( h = 33.1 \, \text{mm} \):
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Cylinder} = 2\pi (5.25)(33.1) = 2\pi (173.625) = 347.25\pi \, \text{mm}^2
\]

#### Step 2.3: Base Area of the Cylinder
The base area of the cylinder (which is also the base of the hemisphere) is given by:
\[
\text{Base Area of Cylinder} = \pi r^2
\]
Substituting \( r = 5.25 \, \text{mm} \):
\[
\text{Base Area of Cylinder} = \pi (5.25)^2 = \pi (27.5625) = 27.5625\pi \, \text{mm}^2
\]

#### Step 2.4: Total Surface Area
The total surface area of the shape is the sum of:
1. The surface area of the hemisphere.
2. The curved surface area of the cylinder.
3. The base area of the cylinder.

\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Surface Area of Hemisphere} + \text{Curved Surface Area of Cylinder} + \text{Base Area of Cylinder}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 55.125\pi + 347.25\pi + 27.5625\pi = 430.9375\pi \, \text{mm}^2
\]

#### Step 2.5: Numerical Approximation
Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 430.9375 \times 3.1416 \approx 1353.58 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The total surface area of the shape is approximately \( 1353.58 \, \text{mm}^2 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{1353.58 \, \text{mm}^2}
\]
