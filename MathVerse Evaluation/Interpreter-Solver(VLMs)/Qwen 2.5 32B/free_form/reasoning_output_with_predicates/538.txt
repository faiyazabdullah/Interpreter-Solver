QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $\left(\frac{3}{5} \pi, 8\right)$ and again at $\left(\frac{7}{5} \pi, 8\right)$. What is the period of the function? Give an exact value.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information from the Graph:
- The graph shows a trigonometric function that oscillates above and below a horizontal line (midline).
- The function intersects its midline at two points:
  - \( \left( \frac{3}{5}\pi, 8 \right) \)
  - \( \left( \frac{7}{5}\pi, 8 \right) \)
- These points are marked on the graph, indicating the intersections with the midline.

#### Predicates Provided:
1. **Point(A)**: This is a generic predicate indicating a point labeled as \( A \).
2. **Point(B)**: This is a generic predicate indicating a point labeled as \( B \).
3. **Equals(A, (Mul(Div(3, 5), pi), 8))**: This specifies that point \( A \) has coordinates \( \left( \frac{3}{5}\pi, 8 \right) \).
4. **Equals(B, (Mul(Div(7, 5), pi), 8))**: This specifies that point \( B \) has coordinates \( \left( \frac{7}{5}\pi, 8 \right) \).

#### Key Observations:
- The midline of the function is the horizontal line passing through \( y = 8 \).
- The function intersects this midline at \( x = \frac{3}{5}\pi \) and \( x = \frac{7}{5}\pi \).
- The period of a trigonometric function is the horizontal distance over which the function repeats itself.

#### Question:
We need to determine the period of the function. The period is the distance between two consecutive points where the function intersects its midline.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the Midline
From the given information and the graph, the midline is the horizontal line \( y = 8 \). This is because the function oscillates symmetrically above and below this line.

#### Step 2.2: Determine the Horizontal Distance Between Consecutive Intersections
The function intersects the midline at:
- \( x_1 = \frac{3}{5}\pi \)
- \( x_2 = \frac{7}{5}\pi \)

The horizontal distance between these two points is:
\[
x_2 - x_1 = \frac{7}{5}\pi - \frac{3}{5}\pi = \frac{4}{5}\pi
\]

#### Step 2.3: Relate the Distance to the Period
In a trigonometric function, the distance between two consecutive points where the function intersects its midline is half the period. This is because the function completes one full cycle (oscillating above and below the midline) over one period. Therefore:
\[
\text{Half the period} = \frac{4}{5}\pi
\]
\[
\text{Period} = 2 \times \frac{4}{5}\pi = \frac{8}{5}\pi
\]

#### Step 2.4: Verify the Result
The period of a trigonometric function is the smallest positive value \( T \) such that the function repeats itself every \( T \) units horizontally. The calculation above confirms that the period is \( \frac{8}{5}\pi \), as the function intersects its midline every \( \frac{4}{5}\pi \) units, which is half the period.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The period of the function is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{8}{5}\pi}
\]
