QUESTION:
A piecewise function, with 2 segments constructed by a line passing (-5,1), (-3,2), and (-1,4) and a line passing (-1,5), (3,3), and (5,1), as shown in the figure. Let $f$ be the function given by the following graph. What is the domain of $f$?

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph shows a piecewise function consisting of two segments:
  1. A straight line segment passing through points \( (-5, 1) \), \( (-3, 2) \), and \( (-1, 4) \).
  2. A curved segment passing through points \( (-1, 5) \), \( (3, 3) \), and \( (5, 1) \).

#### From the Predicates:
- Key points are labeled as:
  - \( A = (-5, 1) \)
  - \( B = (-3, 2) \)
  - \( C = (-1, 5) \)
  - \( D = (3, 3) \)
  - \( E = (5, 1) \)
  - \( F = (-1, 4) \)

- The predicates confirm that:
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( F \) lie on the same straight line.
  - Points \( C \), \( D \), and \( E \) lie on the same curve.

#### Specific Question:
The problem asks for the **domain** of the function \( f \) represented by the graph.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the Domain of Each Segment
1. **First Segment (Straight Line):**
   - The straight line passes through points \( A = (-5, 1) \), \( B = (-3, 2) \), and \( F = (-1, 4) \).
   - The domain of this segment is determined by the \( x \)-coordinates of these points.
   - The smallest \( x \)-coordinate is \( -5 \) (from point \( A \)).
   - The largest \( x \)-coordinate is \( -1 \) (from point \( F \)).
   - Therefore, the domain of the first segment is \( [-5, -1] \).

2. **Second Segment (Curved Line):**
   - The curved line passes through points \( C = (-1, 5) \), \( D = (3, 3) \), and \( E = (5, 1) \).
   - The domain of this segment is determined by the \( x \)-coordinates of these points.
   - The smallest \( x \)-coordinate is \( -1 \) (from point \( C \)).
   - The largest \( x \)-coordinate is \( 5 \) (from point \( E \)).
   - Therefore, the domain of the second segment is \( [-1, 5] \).

#### Step 2.2: Combine the Domains
- The function \( f \) is defined over the union of the domains of its two segments.
- The first segment's domain is \( [-5, -1] \).
- The second segment's domain is \( [-1, 5] \).
- Since the two segments meet at \( x = -1 \), the overall domain is a continuous interval from the smallest \( x \)-value to the largest \( x \)-value.
- Thus, the combined domain is \( [-5, 5] \).

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The domain of the function \( f \) is the set of all \( x \)-values for which \( f(x) \) is defined. Based on the analysis, the domain is the interval \( [-5, 5] \).

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{[-5, 5]}
\]
