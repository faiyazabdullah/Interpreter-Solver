QUESTION:
There are two curves with a vertical asymptote x=3. One curve passes (1,0), and another curve passes (4,0). Estimate the intervals on which the function is increasing or decreasing.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information from the Image:
1. The graph depicts a rational function with a vertical asymptote at \( x = 3 \).
2. There are two curves:
   - One curve passes through the point \( (1, 0) \).
   - Another curve passes through the point \( (4, 0) \).
3. The function appears to have a general form consistent with a rational function, such as \( f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( Q(x) \) has a root at \( x = 3 \).

#### Predicates Analysis:
1. **Points and Lines**:
   - Point \( A \) lies on the line \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 0 \), i.e., \( A = (1, 0) \).
   - Point \( B \) lies on the line \( x = 4 \) and \( y = 0 \), i.e., \( B = (4, 0) \).
   - Both points lie on the respective lines, confirming their coordinates.

2. **Vertical Asymptote**:
   - The vertical dashed line at \( x = 3 \) indicates a vertical asymptote, meaning the denominator of the rational function is zero at \( x = 3 \).

#### Key Observations:
- The function changes direction (increasing/decreasing) around the asymptote and the roots.
- The function crosses the x-axis at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 4 \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify Intervals Based on Roots and Asymptote
The vertical asymptote at \( x = 3 \) divides the real number line into three intervals:
1. \( (-\infty, 1) \)
2. \( (1, 3) \)
3. \( (3, 4) \)
4. \( (4, \infty) \)

The roots at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 4 \) further help us analyze the behavior of the function within these intervals.

#### Step 2.2: Determine Increasing/Decreasing Behavior
To determine whether the function is increasing or decreasing in each interval, we analyze the sign of the derivative \( f'(x) \). However, since the exact functional form is not given, we rely on the graphical behavior.

1. **Interval \( (-\infty, 1) \)**:
   - The function is decreasing because it starts high on the left and moves downward toward the x-axis as it approaches \( x = 1 \).

2. **Interval \( (1, 3) \)**:
   - The function is increasing because it rises from the x-axis at \( x = 1 \) and approaches positive infinity as it gets closer to the vertical asymptote at \( x = 3 \).

3. **Interval \( (3, 4) \)**:
   - The function is decreasing because it comes from negative infinity (as it approaches the vertical asymptote from the right) and moves downward to cross the x-axis at \( x = 4 \).

4. **Interval \( (4, \infty) \)**:
   - The function is increasing because it rises from the x-axis at \( x = 4 \) and continues upward as \( x \) increases.

#### Step 2.3: Summary of Intervals
- **Increasing**: \( (1, 3) \cup (4, \infty) \)
- **Decreasing**: \( (-\infty, 1) \cup (3, 4) \)

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

Based on the analysis, the function is increasing on the intervals \( (1, 3) \) and \( (4, \infty) \), and decreasing on the intervals \( (-\infty, 1) \) and \( (3, 4) \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{Increasing: } (1, 3) \cup (4, \infty), \quad \text{Decreasing: } (-\infty, 1) \cup (3, 4)}
\]
