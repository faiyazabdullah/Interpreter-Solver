QUESTION:
Find the volume of the figure shown, correct to two decimal places. The inner cylinder has a radius of 4 cm and the outer cylinder has a radius of 9 cm. The height of both cylinders is 2 cm.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information:
- The figure consists of two concentric circles forming the bases of two cylinders.
- The inner cylinder has a radius of 4 cm.
- The outer cylinder has a radius of 9 cm.
- The height of both cylinders is given as 2 cm.

#### Predicates:
1. **Circle(1)** and **Circle(2)**: These represent the inner and outer circular bases.
2. **RadiusOf: IsRadiusOf(Line(A,B), Circle(1))** and **RadiusOf: IsRadiusOf(Line(C,D), Circle(2))**:
   - Line(A,B) is the radius of Circle(1), with length 4 cm.
   - Line(C,D) is the radius of Circle(2), with length 9 cm.
3. **HeightOf: HeightOf(1, 2)** and **HeightOf: HeightOf(2, 2)**:
   - Both cylinders have a height of 2 cm.
4. **Equals(HeightOf(1), HeightOf(2))**: The heights of the two cylinders are equal.
5. **VolumeOf: AreaOf(1)** and **VolumeOf: AreaOf(2)**: These indicate that we need to calculate the volumes of the cylinders.

#### Key Measurements:
- Inner cylinder radius \( r_1 = 4 \) cm.
- Outer cylinder radius \( r_2 = 9 \) cm.
- Height of both cylinders \( h = 2 \) cm.

#### Specific Value Asked For:
The question asks for the **volume of the figure shown**, which is the volume of the outer cylinder minus the volume of the inner cylinder (the shaded region).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Volume of a Cylinder
The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.

#### Step 2.2: Volume of the Inner Cylinder
The inner cylinder has:
- Radius \( r_1 = 4 \) cm.
- Height \( h = 2 \) cm.

Using the volume formula:
\[
V_{\text{inner}} = \pi r_1^2 h = \pi (4)^2 (2) = \pi (16)(2) = 32\pi \, \text{cm}^3
\]

#### Step 2.3: Volume of the Outer Cylinder
The outer cylinder has:
- Radius \( r_2 = 9 \) cm.
- Height \( h = 2 \) cm.

Using the volume formula:
\[
V_{\text{outer}} = \pi r_2^2 h = \pi (9)^2 (2) = \pi (81)(2) = 162\pi \, \text{cm}^3
\]

#### Step 2.4: Volume of the Shaded Region
The volume of the shaded region (the figure shown) is the difference between the volume of the outer cylinder and the volume of the inner cylinder:
\[
V_{\text{shaded}} = V_{\text{outer}} - V_{\text{inner}} = 162\pi - 32\pi = 130\pi \, \text{cm}^3
\]

#### Step 2.5: Numerical Approximation
To find the numerical value, use \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
V_{\text{shaded}} = 130\pi \approx 130 \times 3.14159 = 408.41 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The volume of the figure shown is approximately \( 408.41 \, \text{cm}^3 \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{408.41 \text{ cm}^3}\]
