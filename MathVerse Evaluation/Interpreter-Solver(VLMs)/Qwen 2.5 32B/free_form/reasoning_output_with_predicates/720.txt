### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the fully simplified ratio of the volume of the larger cylinder to the volume of the smaller cylinder. The given information includes:
- Volume of Cylinder(1): \( 5760 \, \text{cm}^3 \)
- Volume of Cylinder(2): \( 90 \, \text{cm}^3 \)
- Heights of the cylinders: \( c \, \text{cm} \) for Cylinder(1) and \( 20 \, \text{cm} \) for Cylinder(2).
- The two cylinders are similar.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the problem and the predicates:
1. **Shapes**: Both shapes are cylinders.
2. **Similarity**: The cylinders are similar, meaning their corresponding dimensions (radii and heights) are proportional.
3. **Volumes**: The volumes are given as \( 5760 \, \text{cm}^3 \) and \( 90 \, \text{cm}^3 \).
4. **Heights**: The height of Cylinder(1) is \( c \, \text{cm} \), and the height of Cylinder(2) is \( 20 \, \text{cm} \).

The goal is to find the ratio of the volumes of the larger cylinder to the smaller cylinder. Since the volumes are already provided, the ratio can be directly calculated as:
\[
\text{Ratio of volumes} = \frac{\text{Volume of Cylinder(1)}}{\text{Volume of Cylinder(2)}} = \frac{5760}{90}.
\]

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Calculate the Ratio of Volumes
Using the given volumes:
\[
\text{Ratio of volumes} = \frac{5760}{90}.
\]
Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{5760}{90} = \frac{576}{9} = \frac{192}{3} = 64.
\]

#### Step 2.2: Verify Using Similarity Properties
Since the cylinders are similar, the ratio of their volumes is the cube of the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions (e.g., radii or heights). Let the radius of Cylinder(1) be \( r_1 \) and the radius of Cylinder(2) be \( r_2 \). The height of Cylinder(1) is \( c \), and the height of Cylinder(2) is \( 20 \). The similarity ratio of the heights is:
\[
\text{Ratio of heights} = \frac{c}{20}.
\]
The volume of a cylinder is given by:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h.
\]
For similar cylinders, the ratio of the volumes is:
\[
\left( \frac{r_1}{r_2} \right)^2 \cdot \left( \frac{c}{20} \right) = \left( \frac{c}{20} \right)^3.
\]
However, since the volumes are directly given, we can confirm that the ratio of the volumes is indeed \( 64 \), which is consistent with the cube of the height ratio if needed.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The fully simplified ratio of the volume of the larger cylinder to the volume of the smaller cylinder is:
\[
\boxed{64}.
\]
