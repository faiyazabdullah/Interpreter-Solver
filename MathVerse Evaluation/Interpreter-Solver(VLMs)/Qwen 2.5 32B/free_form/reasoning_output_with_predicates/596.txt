QUESTION:
The line passes (-2,-6) and (2,-3). Write an equation that represents the line.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the equation of a line that passes through two given points: \( A = (-2, -6) \) and \( B = (2, -3) \). The image confirms these points and shows the line passing through them. We will use the given predicates and geometric principles to derive the equation of the line.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the problem statement and predicates:
1. **Points**:
   - Point \( A \) has coordinates \( (-2, -6) \).
   - Point \( B \) has coordinates \( (2, -3) \).
2. **Line**:
   - The line passes through points \( A \) and \( B \).
   - Predicates confirm that \( A \) and \( B \) lie on the line \( \text{Line}(A, B) \).

From the image:
- The line is straight and extends indefinitely in both directions.
- The slope appears consistent, indicating a linear relationship.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Calculate the Slope of the Line
The slope \( m \) of a line passing through two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is given by:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
Substitute the coordinates of points \( A \) and \( B \):
\[
(x_1, y_1) = (-2, -6), \quad (x_2, y_2) = (2, -3)
\]
\[
m = \frac{-3 - (-6)}{2 - (-2)} = \frac{-3 + 6}{2 + 2} = \frac{3}{4}
\]
Thus, the slope of the line is \( m = \frac{3}{4} \).

#### Step 2.2: Use the Point-Slope Form of the Line Equation
The point-slope form of a line equation is:
\[
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
\]
We can use either point \( A \) or \( B \). Let's use point \( A = (-2, -6) \):
\[
y - (-6) = \frac{3}{4}(x - (-2))
\]
Simplify:
\[
y + 6 = \frac{3}{4}(x + 2)
\]

#### Step 2.3: Convert to Slope-Intercept Form
The slope-intercept form of a line equation is:
\[
y = mx + b
\]
Starting from the point-slope form:
\[
y + 6 = \frac{3}{4}(x + 2)
\]
Distribute \( \frac{3}{4} \) on the right-hand side:
\[
y + 6 = \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{3}{4} \cdot 2
\]
\[
y + 6 = \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{6}{4}
\]
\[
y + 6 = \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{3}{2}
\]
Isolate \( y \) by subtracting 6 from both sides:
\[
y = \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{3}{2} - 6
\]
Convert 6 to a fraction with a denominator of 2:
\[
6 = \frac{12}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{3}{2} - \frac{12}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{3 - 12}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{-9}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{3}{4}x - \frac{9}{2}
\]

#### Step 2.4: Verify the Equation
To ensure correctness, substitute the coordinates of point \( B = (2, -3) \) into the equation:
\[
y = \frac{3}{4}x - \frac{9}{2}
\]
Substitute \( x = 2 \) and \( y = -3 \):
\[
-3 = \frac{3}{4}(2) - \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
-3 = \frac{6}{4} - \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
-3 = \frac{3}{2} - \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
-3 = \frac{3 - 9}{2}
\]
\[
-3 = \frac{-6}{2}
\]
\[
-3 = -3
\]
The equation holds true for point \( B \), confirming its correctness.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Final Answer
The equation of the line passing through points \( A = (-2, -6) \) and \( B = (2, -3) \) is:
\[
y = \frac{3}{4}x - \frac{9}{2}
\]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{y = \frac{3}{4}x - \frac{9}{2}}\]
