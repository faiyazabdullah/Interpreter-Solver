### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
#### From the Image:
- The image depicts a hemisphere.
- A dashed line indicates the radius of the hemisphere, labeled as 6.
- The base of the hemisphere is a circle.

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Shape(Hemisphere)**: The geometric figure is a hemisphere.
2. **RadiusOf(Hemisphere)**: The radius of the hemisphere is given.
3. **Equals(RadiusOf(Hemisphere), 6)**: The radius of the hemisphere is explicitly stated as 6.
4. **Circle(BaseOf(Hemisphere))**: The base of the hemisphere is a circle.
5. **IsBaseOf(BaseOf(Hemisphere), Hemisphere)**: The circle is the base of the hemisphere.
6. **IsRadiusOf(RadiusOf(Hemisphere), BaseOf(Hemisphere))**: The radius of the hemisphere is also the radius of its base circle.
7. **AreaOf(BaseOf(Hemisphere))**: We need to find the area of the circular base of the hemisphere.

#### Key Points:
- The radius of the hemisphere is 6.
- The base of the hemisphere is a circle with the same radius.
- We are tasked with finding the area of this circular base.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the Radius of the Base Circle
- By the predicate **Equals(RadiusOf(Hemisphere), 6)**, the radius of the hemisphere is 6.
- By the predicate **IsRadiusOf(RadiusOf(Hemisphere), BaseOf(Hemisphere))**, the radius of the base circle is also 6.

#### Step 2.2: Formula for the Area of a Circle
- The area \( A \) of a circle is given by the formula:
  \[
  A = \pi r^2
  \]
  where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

#### Step 2.3: Substitute the Known Radius
- The radius \( r \) of the base circle is 6.
- Substituting \( r = 6 \) into the formula:
  \[
  A = \pi (6)^2 = \pi \cdot 36 = 36\pi
  \]

#### Step 2.4: Approximate the Area
- To find the numerical value, use the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
  \[
  A \approx 36 \cdot 3.14159 = 113.09724
  \]
- Round the result to three decimal places:
  \[
  A \approx 113.097
  \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The area of the circular base of the hemisphere is \( 36\pi \). Numerically, this is approximately 113.097.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{113.097}\]
