QUESTION:
A cake maker has rectangular boxes measuring $40 \mathrm{~cm}$ in length and 20 $\mathrm{cm}$ in width. The four vertices of the rectangle are (0,0), (0,20), (40,20), (40,0). She often receives orders for cakes in the shape of an ellipse, and wants to determine the largest possible cake that can be made to fit inside the rectangular box.

State the coordinates of the center of the cake in the form $(a, b)$.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Observations from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Rectangle Dimensions**:
   - The rectangle has vertices at \( A(0, 0) \), \( B(40, 0) \), \( C(40, 20) \), and \( D(0, 20) \).
   - The length of the rectangle is \( 40 \) cm (along the \( x \)-axis), and the width is \( 20 \) cm (along the \( y \)-axis).

2. **Ellipse Inscribed in the Rectangle**:
   - An ellipse is inscribed within the rectangle, meaning it touches all four sides of the rectangle.
   - The center of the ellipse is given as \( (20, 10) \).

3. **Geometric Relationships**:
   - The ellipse is symmetric about its center.
   - The major axis of the ellipse will align with the longer side of the rectangle (40 cm), and the minor axis will align with the shorter side of the rectangle (20 cm).

4. **Question Objective**:
   - Determine the coordinates of the center of the ellipse, which will also be the center of the largest possible elliptical cake that fits inside the rectangular box.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the Center of the Ellipse
- From the predicates, the center of the ellipse is explicitly stated as \( (20, 10) \).
- This point is equidistant from all four sides of the rectangle because the ellipse is inscribed and symmetric.

#### Step 2.2: Verify the Symmetry and Alignment
- The rectangle's vertices are \( A(0, 0) \), \( B(40, 0) \), \( C(40, 20) \), and \( D(0, 20) \).
- The midpoint of the rectangle (which is also the center of the inscribed ellipse) can be calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{0 + 40}{2}, \frac{0 + 20}{2} \right) = (20, 10)
  \]
- This confirms that the center of the ellipse is indeed \( (20, 10) \).

#### Step 2.3: Confirm the Largest Possible Cake
- The largest possible elliptical cake that fits inside the rectangle is the one whose major and minor axes are equal to the dimensions of the rectangle.
- The major axis (length) is 40 cm, and the minor axis (width) is 20 cm.
- The center of this ellipse, being the midpoint of the rectangle, ensures that the ellipse is perfectly inscribed and maximizes the area.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

From the above deductions, the coordinates of the center of the largest possible elliptical cake are \( (20, 10) \).

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(20, 10)}
\]
