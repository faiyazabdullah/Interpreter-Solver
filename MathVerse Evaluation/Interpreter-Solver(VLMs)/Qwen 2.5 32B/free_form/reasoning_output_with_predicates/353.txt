QUESTION:
An airplane is currently flying 35^\circ  south of east, as shown in the image.

The control tower orders the plane to change course by turning 7^\circ  to the left. How many degrees south of east is the new course that the plane is ordered to fly?

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual and Predicate Analysis:
1. **Points and Lines**:
   - Points: \( O \), \( A \), \( N \).
   - Lines: \( \text{Line}(O, N) \) and \( \text{Line}(O, A) \).

2. **Geometric Relationships**:
   - \( \text{Perpendicular}(\text{Line}(O, N), \text{Line}(O, A)) \): The lines \( \text{Line}(O, N) \) and \( \text{Line}(O, A) \) are perpendicular.
   - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(A, O, N)) = 35^\circ \): The angle between \( \text{Line}(O, A) \) and \( \text{Line}(O, N) \) is \( 35^\circ \).

3. **Interpretation**:
   - The line \( \text{Line}(O, N) \) represents the north-south direction (vertical axis).
   - The line \( \text{Line}(O, A) \) represents the plane's current direction, which is \( 35^\circ \) south of east.
   - The plane is ordered to turn \( 7^\circ \) to the left.

#### Key Measurements and Relationships:
- The current direction of the plane is \( 35^\circ \) south of east.
- Turning \( 7^\circ \) to the left means decreasing the angle by \( 7^\circ \).

#### Question:
We need to determine the new angle south of east after the plane turns \( 7^\circ \) to the left.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understand the Current Direction
- The plane is currently flying \( 35^\circ \) south of east. This means the angle between the plane's direction (\( \text{Line}(O, A) \)) and the north-south line (\( \text{Line}(O, N) \)) is \( 35^\circ \).

#### Step 2.2: Effect of Turning Left
- Turning \( 7^\circ \) to the left decreases the angle between the plane's new direction and the north-south line.
- The new angle south of east is calculated by subtracting \( 7^\circ \) from the original \( 35^\circ \):
  \[
  \text{New angle} = 35^\circ - 7^\circ = 28^\circ.
  \]

#### Step 2.3: Verify the New Direction
- After turning \( 7^\circ \) to the left, the plane's direction is now \( 28^\circ \) south of east. This is consistent with the problem's requirements and the geometric setup.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The new course that the plane is ordered to fly is \( 28^\circ \) south of east.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{28^\circ}\]
