QUESTION:
The graph shows the price change, in dollars, of a toy for different levels of demand. The x-axis represents quantity (thousand units), and the y-axis represents price.

What is the average rate of change?

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph depicts a linear relationship between the price (y-axis) and the quantity demanded (x-axis).
- Key points on the graph:
  - At \( x = 6 \), \( y = 14 \).
  - At \( x = 16 \), \( y = 22 \).

#### Predicates:
- **Point(A)** and **Point(B)** represent two points on the line.
- **Line(A,B)** indicates a straight line passing through these points.
- **PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(A,B))** and **PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,B))** confirm that points A and B lie on the line.
- The given predicates also provide the coordinates of the points:
  - Point A: \( (6, 14) \)
  - Point B: \( (16, 22) \)

#### Question:
We need to calculate the **average rate of change** of the price with respect to the quantity demanded. This is equivalent to finding the slope of the line.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Formula for Average Rate of Change
The average rate of change between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]

#### Step 2.2: Identify Coordinates
From the image and predicates:
- Point A: \( (x_1, y_1) = (6, 14) \)
- Point B: \( (x_2, y_2) = (16, 22) \)

#### Step 2.3: Calculate \(\Delta y\) and \(\Delta x\)
Using the coordinates:
\[
\Delta y = y_2 - y_1 = 22 - 14 = 8
\]
\[
\Delta x = x_2 - x_1 = 16 - 6 = 10
\]

#### Step 2.4: Compute the Slope
Substitute \(\Delta y\) and \(\Delta x\) into the formula:
\[
\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{8}{10} = 0.8
\]

#### Step 2.5: Interpret the Result
The average rate of change represents the change in price per unit change in quantity demanded. Here, the price increases by \$0.80 for every thousand-unit increase in quantity demanded.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The average rate of change is \(0.8\) dollars per thousand units.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{0.8}
\]
