FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information:
- The image depicts a circle with a radius indicated as \( 3 \, \text{cm} \).
- The radius is labeled as \( 3 \, \text{cm} \).

#### Predicates:
1. **Circle(C)**: There is a circle denoted as \( C \).
2. **IsRadiusOf(R, C)**: A segment \( R \) is identified as the radius of the circle \( C \).
3. **LengthOf(R, 3)**: The length of the radius \( R \) is given as \( 3 \, \text{cm} \).

#### Key Relationships:
- The radius of the circle is explicitly stated as \( 3 \, \text{cm} \).
- The task is to find the exact area of the circle.

#### Question:
We need to calculate the exact area of the circle, expressed in terms of \( \pi \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Recall the Formula for the Area of a Circle
The formula for the area \( A \) of a circle is:
\[
A = \pi r^2
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

#### Step 2.2: Identify the Radius
From the predicates and the image, the radius \( r \) is given as:
\[
r = 3 \, \text{cm}
\]

#### Step 2.3: Substitute the Radius into the Formula
Substitute \( r = 3 \) into the area formula:
\[
A = \pi (3)^2
\]

#### Step 2.4: Simplify the Expression
Calculate \( 3^2 \):
\[
3^2 = 9
\]
Thus, the area becomes:
\[
A = \pi \cdot 9 = 9\pi
\]

#### Step 2.5: Verify Units
The radius is given in centimeters, so the area will be in square centimeters (\( \text{cm}^2 \)).

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The exact area of the circle is:
\[
9\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{9\pi \, \text{cm}^2}
\]
