### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the **true bearing of point \( C \) from point \( B \)** in the given geometric configuration. Here's a breakdown of the critical information:

1. **Triangle \( \triangle ABC \)**:
   - Angles at vertices:
     - \( \angle BAC = 38^\circ \)
     - \( \angle ABC = 49^\circ \)

2. **Lines and Directions**:
   - Line \( AB \) is horizontal, pointing to the right.
   - Line \( BC \) is also horizontal, pointing to the right.
   - Line \( AC \) connects points \( A \) and \( C \).
   - Parallel and perpendicular relationships are indicated in the predicates:
     - Line \( AB \parallel BC \).
     - Line \( AC \) is perpendicular to line \( AB \).

3. **Objective**:
   - Determine the **true bearing** of point \( C \) from point \( B \). True bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction.

---

### Step-by-Step Deductive Reasoning:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**
From the problem and the image:
- Point \( A \) is directly above the horizontal line \( AB \), and line \( AC \) is perpendicular to \( AB \).
- Point \( B \) is also on the horizontal line \( AB \), and line \( BC \) is parallel to \( AB \).
- The angles \( \angle BAC = 38^\circ \) and \( \angle ABC = 49^\circ \) are internal angles of \( \triangle ABC \).

#### **Step 2: Calculate the Third Angle of \( \triangle ABC \)**
In any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is \( 180^\circ \):
\[
\angle BCA = 180^\circ - \angle BAC - \angle ABC
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
\angle BCA = 180^\circ - 38^\circ - 49^\circ = 93^\circ
\]

#### **Step 3: Determine the Direction of Line \( BC \)**
- Since line \( BC \) is parallel to line \( AB \), and line \( AB \) is horizontal (pointing to the right), line \( BC \) is also horizontal (pointing to the right).
- The bearing of line \( BC \) from point \( B \) is therefore \( 0^\circ \) (due east).

#### **Step 4: Analyze the Position of Point \( C \) Relative to Point \( B \)**
- From the triangle, we know that \( \angle ABC = 49^\circ \). This angle is the angle between the horizontal line \( BC \) and the line \( AC \).
- Since \( AC \) is perpendicular to \( AB \), line \( AC \) is vertical (upward from \( A \)).
- The direction of \( AC \) is \( 90^\circ \) (measured clockwise from north).

#### **Step 5: Calculate the True Bearing of \( C \) from \( B \)**
- The true bearing of \( C \) from \( B \) is the direction of line \( BC \) plus the angle \( \angle ABC \):
  - Line \( BC \) is due east (\( 0^\circ \)).
  - Adding \( \angle ABC = 49^\circ \) to the east direction gives:
    \[
    \text{True Bearing} = 0^\circ + 49^\circ = 49^\circ
    \]

---

### Final Answer:
The true bearing of point \( C \) from point \( B \) is:
\[
\boxed{49^\circ}
\]
