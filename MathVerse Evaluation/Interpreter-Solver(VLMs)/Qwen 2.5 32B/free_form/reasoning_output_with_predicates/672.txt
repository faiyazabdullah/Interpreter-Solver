### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and the given predicates, we extract the following key information:
1. The composite figure consists of a **cone** and a **hemisphere** joined at their bases.
2. The **radius** of both the cone's base and the hemisphere is \( r = 4 \) cm.
3. The **perpendicular height** of the cone is \( h = 10 \) cm.
4. The surface area of the composite figure includes:
   - The curved surface area of the cone.
   - The curved surface area of the hemisphere.
   - **Exclusion of the base areas**, as they are joined together and do not contribute to the external surface area.

#### Key Measurements:
- Radius of the cone and hemisphere: \( r = 4 \) cm.
- Perpendicular height of the cone: \( h = 10 \) cm.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### **Step 2.1: Calculate the Slant Height of the Cone**
The slant height (\( l \)) of the cone can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius, height, and slant height of the cone:
\[
l = \sqrt{r^2 + h^2}
\]
Substitute \( r = 4 \) cm and \( h = 10 \) cm:
\[
l = \sqrt{4^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{16 + 100} = \sqrt{116} = 2\sqrt{29} \quad \text{cm}.
\]

#### **Step 2.2: Curved Surface Area of the Cone**
The formula for the curved surface area of a cone is:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Cone} = \pi r l
\]
Substitute \( r = 4 \) cm and \( l = 2\sqrt{29} \) cm:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Cone} = \pi (4)(2\sqrt{29}) = 8\pi\sqrt{29} \quad \text{cm}^2.
\]

#### **Step 2.3: Curved Surface Area of the Hemisphere**
The formula for the curved surface area of a hemisphere is:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2\pi r^2
\]
Substitute \( r = 4 \) cm:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2\pi (4^2) = 2\pi (16) = 32\pi \quad \text{cm}^2.
\]

#### **Step 2.4: Total Surface Area of the Composite Figure**
The total surface area of the composite figure is the sum of the curved surface area of the cone and the curved surface area of the hemisphere:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Curved Surface Area of Cone} + \text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 8\pi\sqrt{29} + 32\pi \quad \text{cm}^2.
\]

#### **Step 2.5: Numerical Approximation**
To find the numerical value, approximate \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \) and \( \sqrt{29} \approx 5.385 \):
\[
8\pi\sqrt{29} \approx 8 \times 3.1416 \times 5.385 \approx 134.04 \quad \text{cm}^2,
\]
\[
32\pi \approx 32 \times 3.1416 \approx 100.53 \quad \text{cm}^2.
\]
Add these values:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 134.04 + 100.53 = 234.57 \quad \text{cm}^2.
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The total surface area of the composite figure is:
\[
\boxed{234.57 \text{ cm}^2}.
\]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{234.57 \text{ cm}^2}\]
