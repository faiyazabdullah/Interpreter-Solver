QUESTION:
There is a curve goes through (-5,2), (-1,0), and (3,2). The point at (-5,2) and (3,2) are respectively solid and hollow. Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Observations:
1. The graph shows a smooth curve passing through the points \((-5, 2)\), \((-1, 0)\), and \((3, 2)\).
2. The point \((-5, 2)\) is marked with a solid dot, indicating it is included in the function's graph.
3. The point \((3, 2)\) is marked with a hollow dot, indicating it is excluded from the function's graph.
4. The curve appears to extend beyond these points, suggesting the domain and range are not limited to just these three points.

#### Predicates Analysis:
- **Points**:
  - \(A\) lies on the line \(x = -5\) and \(y = 2\), so \(A = (-5, 2)\).
  - \(B\) lies on the line \(x = -1\) and \(y = 0\), so \(B = (-1, 0)\).
  - \(C\) lies on the line \(x = 3\) and \(y = 2\), so \(C = (3, 2)\).
- **Key Relationships**:
  - The curve passes through the points \((-5, 2)\), \((-1, 0)\), and \((3, 2)\).
  - The point \((-5, 2)\) is included in the function (solid dot).
  - The point \((3, 2)\) is excluded from the function (hollow dot).

#### Question Breakdown:
We need to determine the **domain** and **range** of the function represented by the curve. The domain is the set of all possible \(x\)-values, and the range is the set of all possible \(y\)-values.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Domain Analysis:
1. **Identify the \(x\)-values**:
   - From the graph, the curve starts at \(x = -5\) (inclusive, since the point is solid) and extends to \(x = 3\) (exclusive, since the point is hollow).
   - There are no other visible breaks or discontinuities in the \(x\)-direction.

2. **Formulate the Domain**:
   - The domain includes all \(x\)-values from \(-5\) to \(3\), but does not include \(3\).
   - In interval notation, this is written as \([-5, 3)\).

#### Range Analysis:
1. **Identify the \(y\)-values**:
   - From the graph, the lowest point of the curve is at \((-1, 0)\), where \(y = 0\).
   - The highest point of the curve is at \((-5, 2)\) and \((3, 2)\), where \(y = 2\).
   - The curve does not go below \(y = 0\) or above \(y = 2\).

2. **Formulate the Range**:
   - The range includes all \(y\)-values from \(0\) to \(2\), inclusive.
   - In interval notation, this is written as \([0, 2]\).

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

#### Final Answer:
The domain of the function is \([-5, 3)\), and the range is \([0, 2]\).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{\text{Domain: } [-5, 3), \quad \text{Range: } [0, 2]}\]
