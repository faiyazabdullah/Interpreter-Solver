====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The solid is formed by cutting out a quarter of a sphere from a cube.
- The visible dimensions include:
  - Side length of the cube: \( 14.2 \) cm.
  - Radius of the quarter-sphere: \( 7.1 \) cm (half of the cube's side length).

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Shape(cube)**: The base shape is a cube.
2. **Shape(sphere)**: A quarter of a sphere is removed.
3. **LengthOf(side) = 14.2**: The side length of the cube is \( 14.2 \) cm.
4. **LengthOf(radius) = 7.1**: The radius of the quarter-sphere is \( 7.1 \) cm.
5. **Div(LengthOf(side), 2) = LengthOf(radius)**: The radius of the quarter-sphere is half the side length of the cube.

#### Key Measurements and Relationships:
- Cube side length: \( s = 14.2 \) cm.
- Sphere radius: \( r = 7.1 \) cm.
- The quarter-sphere is cut out such that its center coincides with one corner of the cube.

#### What We Need to Find:
The total surface area of the resulting solid after removing the quarter-sphere from the cube.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### **Step 2.1: Surface Area of the Original Cube**
The surface area of a cube with side length \( s \) is given by:
\[
\text{Surface Area of Cube} = 6s^2
\]
Substituting \( s = 14.2 \):
\[
\text{Surface Area of Cube} = 6 \times (14.2)^2 = 6 \times 201.64 = 1209.84 \text{ cm}^2
\]

#### **Step 2.2: Surface Area Removed by the Quarter-Sphere**
When a quarter-sphere is cut out, three faces of the cube are affected:
1. One face is replaced by the curved surface of the quarter-sphere.
2. Two triangular sections (where the quarter-sphere meets the cube) are removed from two adjacent faces.

##### **Curved Surface Area of the Quarter-Sphere**
The surface area of a full sphere is \( 4\pi r^2 \). For a quarter-sphere, the curved surface area is:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Quarter-Sphere} = \frac{1}{4} \times 4\pi r^2 = \pi r^2
\]
Substituting \( r = 7.1 \):
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Quarter-Sphere} = \pi (7.1)^2 = \pi \times 50.41 = 50.41\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

##### **Planar Areas Removed from the Cube**
Each planar section where the quarter-sphere meets the cube forms a quarter-circle. There are two such sections, each with an area equal to a quarter of the area of a full circle of radius \( r \):
\[
\text{Area of One Quarter-Circle} = \frac{1}{4} \pi r^2
\]
Substituting \( r = 7.1 \):
\[
\text{Area of One Quarter-Circle} = \frac{1}{4} \pi (7.1)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \pi \times 50.41 = 12.6025\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]
Since there are two such sections:
\[
\text{Total Planar Area Removed} = 2 \times 12.6025\pi = 25.205\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

#### **Step 2.3: Adjusting the Surface Area**
The total surface area of the modified solid includes:
1. The original surface area of the cube minus the areas of the two quarter-circles.
2. The addition of the curved surface area of the quarter-sphere.

The net change in surface area is:
\[
\text{Net Change in Surface Area} = \text{Curved Surface Area of Quarter-Sphere} - \text{Total Planar Area Removed}
\]
\[
\text{Net Change in Surface Area} = 50.41\pi - 25.205\pi = 25.205\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

#### **Step 2.4: Total Surface Area of the Modified Solid**
The total surface area of the modified solid is:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Surface Area of Cube} + \text{Net Change in Surface Area}
\]
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 1209.84 + 25.205\pi
\]

Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):
\[
25.205\pi \approx 25.205 \times 3.1416 \approx 79.147 \text{ cm}^2
\]
Thus:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 1209.84 + 79.147 = 1288.987 \text{ cm}^2
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The total surface area of the modified solid is:
\[
\boxed{1288.99 \text{ cm}^2}
\] (rounded to two decimal places).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{1288.99 \text{ cm}^2}\]
