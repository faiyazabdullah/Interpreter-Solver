### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the true bearing of point \( A \) from point \( O \). The given information includes:
1. The angle between the line \( OA \) and the positive direction of the \( x \)-axis is \( 28^\circ \).
2. The line \( ON \) is vertical, and it is perpendicular to the horizontal axis.
3. The angle between the vertical line \( ON \) and the horizontal axis is \( 90^\circ \).

#### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and predicates:
- Point \( O \) is the origin.
- Point \( A \) lies in the fourth quadrant.
- The angle \( \angle AON \) is \( 28^\circ \).
- The line \( ON \) is vertical, and thus perpendicular to the horizontal axis.
- The true bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction.

#### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify the Reference Directions:**
   - The positive \( y \)-axis (north direction) is aligned with the line \( ON \).
   - The positive \( x \)-axis is horizontal and points to the right.

2. **Determine the Angle Between \( OA \) and the North Direction:**
   - The angle between \( OA \) and the positive \( x \)-axis is given as \( 28^\circ \).
   - Since \( ON \) is vertical, the angle between \( ON \) and the positive \( x \)-axis is \( 90^\circ \).
   - Therefore, the angle between \( OA \) and \( ON \) is \( 28^\circ \).

3. **Calculate the True Bearing:**
   - The true bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction.
   - Since \( OA \) is in the fourth quadrant, the angle between \( OA \) and the north direction is:
     \[
     90^\circ + 28^\circ = 118^\circ
     \]
   - This means that point \( A \) is located at an angle of \( 118^\circ \) clockwise from the north direction.

#### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The true bearing of point \( A \) from point \( O \) is \( 118^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{118^\circ}
\]
