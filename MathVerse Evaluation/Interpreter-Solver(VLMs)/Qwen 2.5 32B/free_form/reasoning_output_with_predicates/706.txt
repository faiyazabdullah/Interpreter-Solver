FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Information from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Triangle \( T1 \)**:
   - It is an isosceles triangle (\(\triangle T1\) is isosceles).
   - The base of the triangle has a length of 12 cm (\(\text{LengthOf}(BaseOf(T1), 12)\)).
   - The two equal sides (waist lengths) of the triangle have a length of 10 cm (\(\text{LengthOf}(IsSideOf(T1), 10)\)).
   - The altitude (height) of the triangle is denoted by \( x \) (\(\text{LengthOf}(AltitudeOf(T1), x)\)).
   - The altitude is perpendicular to the base (\(\text{Perpendicular}(BaseOf(T1), AltitudeOf(T1))\)).

2. **Triangular Prism \( \text{Prism1} \)**:
   - The base of the prism is the isosceles triangle \( T1 \) (\(\text{BaseOf}(Prism1, T1)\)).
   - The height of the prism is 16 cm (\(\text{HeightOf}(Prism1, 16)\)).

#### Goal:
Find the total surface area of the triangular prism. The total surface area includes the areas of the two triangular bases and the three rectangular lateral faces.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### **Step 2.1: Calculate the Altitude \( x \) of the Isosceles Triangle**
The altitude \( x \) divides the isosceles triangle into two congruent right triangles. Each right triangle has:
- Hypotenuse = 10 cm (one of the equal sides of the isosceles triangle),
- One leg = \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) cm (half the base of the isosceles triangle),
- The other leg = \( x \) (the altitude).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in one of these right triangles:
\[
x^2 + 6^2 = 10^2
\]
\[
x^2 + 36 = 100
\]
\[
x^2 = 64
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{64} = 8 \quad \text{(since altitude is positive)}
\]
Thus, the altitude \( x \) of the isosceles triangle is \( 8 \) cm.

#### **Step 2.2: Calculate the Area of the Base Triangle**
The area \( A_{\text{base}} \) of the isosceles triangle is given by:
\[
A_{\text{base}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Altitude}
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
A_{\text{base}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 8 = 48 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### **Step 2.3: Calculate the Perimeter of the Base Triangle**
To find the lateral surface area, we need the perimeter of the base triangle. The perimeter \( P \) is:
\[
P = \text{Base} + 2 \times \text{Waist}
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
P = 12 + 2 \times 10 = 12 + 20 = 32 \, \text{cm}
\]

#### **Step 2.4: Calculate the Lateral Surface Area of the Prism**
The lateral surface area \( A_{\text{lateral}} \) of the prism is the product of the perimeter of the base triangle and the height of the prism:
\[
A_{\text{lateral}} = P \times \text{Height of Prism}
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
A_{\text{lateral}} = 32 \times 16 = 512 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### **Step 2.5: Calculate the Total Surface Area of the Prism**
The total surface area \( A_{\text{total}} \) of the prism is the sum of the areas of the two triangular bases and the lateral surface area:
\[
A_{\text{total}} = 2 \times A_{\text{base}} + A_{\text{lateral}}
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
A_{\text{total}} = 2 \times 48 + 512 = 96 + 512 = 608 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The total surface area of the triangular prism is:
\[
\boxed{608 \text{ cm}^2}
\]
