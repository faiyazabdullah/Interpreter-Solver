FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Observations from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Shape**: The figure is a hollow cylinder (a cylindrical shell).
2. **Dimensions**:
   - Outer radius \( R = 11 \) cm.
   - Inner radius \( r = 10 \) cm.
   - Length (or height) \( h = 24 \) cm.
3. **Objective**: Calculate the total surface area of the hollow cylinder. This includes:
   - The lateral surface area of the outer cylinder.
   - The lateral surface area of the inner cylinder.
   - The areas of the two circular bases (outer and inner).

#### Formal Predicates:
- Circle(1): Outer circle with radius \( R = 11 \) cm.
- Circle(2): Inner circle with radius \( r = 10 \) cm.
- LengthOf(Line(1,2)) = 24: The height of the cylinder is 24 cm.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Lateral Surface Area of the Outer Cylinder
The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi Rh
\]
Substitute \( R = 11 \) cm and \( h = 24 \) cm:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area (Outer)} = 2\pi (11)(24) = 528\pi \quad \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 2.2: Lateral Surface Area of the Inner Cylinder
Similarly, the lateral surface area of the inner cylinder is:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi rh
\]
Substitute \( r = 10 \) cm and \( h = 24 \) cm:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area (Inner)} = 2\pi (10)(24) = 480\pi \quad \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 2.3: Areas of the Circular Bases
The total area of the two circular bases consists of:
- The area of the outer circular base.
- The area of the inner circular base.

The area of a circle is given by \( \pi R^2 \). Since there are two bases (one outer and one inner), we calculate:
\[
\text{Area of Outer Base} = \pi R^2 = \pi (11)^2 = 121\pi \quad \text{cm}^2
\]
\[
\text{Area of Inner Base} = \pi r^2 = \pi (10)^2 = 100\pi \quad \text{cm}^2
\]
Thus, the total area of the two bases is:
\[
\text{Total Base Area} = 2(\pi R^2 - \pi r^2) = 2(\pi (11^2) - \pi (10^2)) = 2(\pi (121) - \pi (100)) = 2(21\pi) = 42\pi \quad \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 2.4: Total Surface Area
The total surface area of the hollow cylinder is the sum of:
1. The lateral surface area of the outer cylinder.
2. The lateral surface area of the inner cylinder.
3. The total area of the two bases.

\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Lateral Surface Area (Outer)} + \text{Lateral Surface Area (Inner)} + \text{Total Base Area}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 528\pi + 480\pi + 42\pi = 1050\pi \quad \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 2.5: Numerical Evaluation
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 1050 \times 3.14159 \approx 3298.97 \quad \text{cm}^2
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The total surface area of the hollow cylinder is approximately \( 3298.97 \) cmÂ². Rounded to the nearest two decimal places, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3298.97}
\]
