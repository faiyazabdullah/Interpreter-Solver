QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $\left(\frac{2}{3} \pi, 1.2\right)$, and it has a minimum point at $\left(\frac{4}{3} \pi,-3.4\right)$. What is the amplitude of the function?

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information from the Graph:
1. The graph shows a trigonometric function that appears sinusoidal.
2. The function intersects its midline at the point \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\pi, 1.2\right)\).
3. The function has a minimum point at \(\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi, -3.4\right)\).

#### Formal Predicates:
- **Point(A)**: Represents the intersection point of the function with its midline.
- **Point(B)**: Represents the minimum point of the function.
- **Line(l)**: Represents the midline of the function.
- **PointLiesOnLine(A, l)**: Point \(A\) lies on the midline \(l\).
- **PointLiesOnLine(B, l)**: Point \(B\) does not lie on the midline \(l\).
- **Equals(A, (\frac{2}{3}\pi, 1.2))**: The coordinates of point \(A\) are \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\pi, 1.2\right)\).
- **Equals(B, (\frac{4}{3}\pi, -3.4))**: The coordinates of point \(B\) are \(\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi, -3.4\right)\).
- **Equals(LengthOf(l), 1.2)**: The length of the midline (which is the vertical distance from the midline to the maximum or minimum points) is 1.2.

#### Key Observations:
- The midline of the function is a horizontal line passing through \(y = 1.2\).
- The minimum point of the function is at \(\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi, -3.4\right)\), which is below the midline.
- The amplitude of the function is the vertical distance from the midline to either the maximum or minimum point.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the Midline
- From the predicate **Equals(LengthOf(l), 1.2)**, we know the midline is a horizontal line at \(y = 1.2\). This is confirmed by the fact that the function intersects its midline at \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\pi, 1.2\right)\).

#### Step 2.2: Determine the Amplitude
- The amplitude of a trigonometric function is the vertical distance from the midline to the maximum or minimum point.
- The minimum point of the function is given as \(\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi, -3.4\right)\).
- The vertical distance from the midline \(y = 1.2\) to the minimum point \(y = -3.4\) is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Amplitude} = |1.2 - (-3.4)| = |1.2 + 3.4| = 4.6
  \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The amplitude of the function is the vertical distance from the midline to the minimum point, which we have calculated to be 4.6.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{4.6}\]
