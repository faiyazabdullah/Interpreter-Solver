QUESTION:
There are two quadratic functions. The red one is g(x) that goes through the origin and point (2, -4). Find the equation of the dashed line in red. Use exact numbers.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
1. The red dashed line represents the graph of the quadratic function \( g(x) \).
2. The graph passes through the origin \((0, 0)\) and the point \((2, -4)\).
3. The blue solid line represents another quadratic function \( f(x) \), but it is not relevant to finding \( g(x) \).

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Point(Origin)**: The origin is \((0, 0)\).
2. **Point(P)**: Point \( P \) is \((2, -4)\).
3. **Equals(Origin, (0,0))**: Confirms the origin's coordinates.
4. **Equals(P, (2,-4))**: Confirms the coordinates of point \( P \).
5. **PointLiesOnLine(Origin, Line(g))**: The origin lies on the graph of \( g(x) \).
6. **PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(g))**: Point \( P \) lies on the graph of \( g(x) \).
7. **Shape(g)**: \( g(x) \) is a shape, specifically a quadratic function.
8. **Red(Shape(g))**: The graph of \( g(x) \) is red.
9. **Blue(Shape(f))**: The graph of \( f(x) \) is blue.
10. **LengthOf(Origin)**: The length of the origin is 0 (irrelevant here).
11. **LengthOf(P)**: The length of point \( P \) is 2 (likely a typo; irrelevant here).
12. **Equals(Origin, 0)**: The origin is at \((0, 0)\).
13. **LengthOf(P)**: The length of point \( P \) is 2 (likely a typo; irrelevant here).
14. **PointLiesOnLine(Origin, Line(f))**: The origin also lies on the graph of \( f(x) \).

#### Key Observations:
- The quadratic function \( g(x) \) passes through \((0, 0)\) and \((2, -4)\).
- Since \( g(x) \) is a quadratic function, its general form is:
  \[
  g(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
  \]
- Substituting the given points will help us determine the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Use the fact that \( g(x) \) passes through the origin.
- Since \( g(x) \) passes through \((0, 0)\), substituting \( x = 0 \) and \( g(0) = 0 \) into the general form \( g(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \):
  \[
  g(0) = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = 0 \implies c = 0
  \]
  Thus, the equation simplifies to:
  \[
  g(x) = ax^2 + bx
  \]

#### Step 2.2: Use the fact that \( g(x) \) passes through \((2, -4)\).
- Substituting \( x = 2 \) and \( g(2) = -4 \) into the simplified form \( g(x) = ax^2 + bx \):
  \[
  g(2) = a(2)^2 + b(2) = -4 \implies 4a + 2b = -4
  \]
  Simplify the equation:
  \[
  2a + b = -2 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
  \]

#### Step 2.3: Determine the vertex form or additional properties.
- The graph of \( g(x) \) is a parabola that opens upwards (as seen in the image). However, we do not have enough information to directly determine the vertex. Instead, we use the two points to solve for \( a \) and \( b \).

#### Step 2.4: Solve for \( a \) and \( b \).
- We already have one equation:
  \[
  2a + b = -2
  \]
- To find a second equation, we need more information. Since no additional points or symmetry information is provided, we assume the simplest approach using the given points.

#### Step 2.5: Assume symmetry or additional properties.
- The graph appears symmetric about the vertical line \( x = 1 \) (visual inspection). This suggests the vertex might be at \( x = 1 \). However, without explicit confirmation, we proceed with the two-point method.

#### Step 2.6: Solve the system of equations.
- From Equation 1: \( b = -2 - 2a \).
- Substitute \( b = -2 - 2a \) back into the general form \( g(x) = ax^2 + bx \):
  \[
  g(x) = ax^2 + (-2 - 2a)x = ax^2 - 2x - 2ax
  \]
- To find \( a \) and \( b \), we use the fact that the graph passes through \((2, -4)\):
  \[
  g(2) = a(2)^2 + b(2) = -4 \implies 4a + 2b = -4
  \]
  Substitute \( b = -2 - 2a \):
  \[
  4a + 2(-2 - 2a) = -4 \implies 4a - 4 - 4a = -4 \implies -4 = -4
  \]
  This confirms the consistency of the equation. Solving for \( a \) and \( b \):
  \[
  b = -2 - 2a
  \]
  Using the symmetry or vertex form, we assume the simplest quadratic that fits the points:
  \[
  g(x) = -x^2 + 2x
  \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The quadratic function \( g(x) \) that passes through the origin and the point \((2, -4)\) is:
\[
g(x) = -x^2 + 2x
\]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{-x^2 + 2x}\]
