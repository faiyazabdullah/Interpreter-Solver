### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of the angle \( \theta \) in a right triangle where:
- One leg has a length of 12,
- The hypotenuse has a length of \( 8\sqrt{3} \),
- The angle \( \theta \) is opposite the leg of length 12.

From the given predicates and the image:
1. The triangle is a right triangle with a right angle at vertex \( B \).
2. The hypotenuse \( AC \) has a length of \( 8\sqrt{3} \).
3. One of the legs \( AB \) has a length of 12.
4. The angle \( \theta \) is the angle at vertex \( A \).

Our goal is to determine \( \theta \) in degrees.

---

### Step 1: Identify Key Relationships
In a right triangle, trigonometric ratios relate the sides to the angles. Specifically:
- The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.
- The cosine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.
- The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the adjacent side.

Here, \( \theta \) is the angle opposite the leg of length 12. Therefore, we can use the sine function:
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{12}{8\sqrt{3}}
\]

---

### Step 2: Simplify the Expression
Simplify the ratio:
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{12}{8\sqrt{3}} = \frac{12}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{3}}
\]
Rationalize the denominator:
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

---

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta \)
The sine function \( \sin(\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) corresponds to a well-known angle in trigonometry. From the unit circle or standard trigonometric values:
\[
\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Therefore:
\[
\theta = 60^\circ
\]

---

### Step 4: Verify the Solution
To ensure correctness, we can check the Pythagorean theorem for the triangle:
- Hypotenuse \( AC = 8\sqrt{3} \)
- One leg \( AB = 12 \)
- The other leg \( BC \) can be found using:
\[
BC = \sqrt{(AC)^2 - (AB)^2} = \sqrt{(8\sqrt{3})^2 - 12^2} = \sqrt{192 - 144} = \sqrt{48} = 4\sqrt{3}
\]
This confirms the sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, and the trigonometric relationship holds.

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{60^\circ}
\]
