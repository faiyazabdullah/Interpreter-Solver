QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, on the graph.

Write the equation of the circle in the form \left(x-h\right)^2+\left(y-k\right)^2=r^2.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The image shows a circle centered at approximately \((-2, -3)\).
- The circle intersects the \(x\)-axis at two points and the \(y\)-axis at two points, indicating that it passes through four points on the axes.
- The radius appears to be about 3 units, as visually estimated from the center to the edge of the circle.

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Circle(1)**: There is a circle labeled as Circle 1.
2. **Point(A), Point(B), Point(C), Point(D)**: Four points are defined.
3. **PointLiesOnCircle(A,1), PointLiesOnCircle(B,1), PointLiesOnCircle(C,1), PointLiesOnCircle(D,1)**: These points lie on Circle 1.
4. **Equals(A, -3)**: Point \(A\) has an \(x\)-coordinate of \(-3\).
5. **Equals(B, -2)**: Point \(B\) has an \(x\)-coordinate of \(-2\).
6. **Equals(C, 3)**: Point \(C\) has an \(x\)-coordinate of \(3\).
7. **Equals(Pow(C, 2), 9)**: This implies \(C^2 = 9\), so \(C = 3\) or \(C = -3\). Since \(C\) is already given as 3, this is consistent.

#### Key Observations:
- The circle intersects the axes, meaning its equation will involve the coordinates of these intersection points.
- The center of the circle is visually estimated to be \((-2, -3)\), and the radius appears to be 3.
- We need to confirm the exact center and radius using the given information and then write the equation of the circle in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Determine the Center of the Circle
From the image, the center of the circle appears to be at \((-2, -3)\). Let us denote the center as \((h, k) = (-2, -3)\).

#### Step 2.2: Determine the Radius of the Circle
The radius can be determined using the distance from the center to any point on the circle. From the image, the circle appears to pass through the point \((1, -3)\), which lies on the \(x\)-axis. The distance from the center \((-2, -3)\) to \((1, -3)\) is:
\[
r = \sqrt{(1 - (-2))^2 + (-3 - (-3))^2} = \sqrt{(1 + 2)^2 + (0)^2} = \sqrt{3^2} = 3
\]
Thus, the radius \(r = 3\).

#### Step 2.3: Write the Equation of the Circle
The general equation of a circle with center \((h, k)\) and radius \(r\) is:
\[
(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
\]
Substituting \(h = -2\), \(k = -3\), and \(r = 3\):
\[
(x - (-2))^2 + (y - (-3))^2 = 3^2
\]
Simplifying:
\[
(x + 2)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 9
\]

#### Step 2.4: Verify the Equation
- The center \((-2, -3)\) is consistent with the visual observation.
- The radius \(3\) is consistent with the distance from the center to the points on the circle.
- The equation \((x + 2)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 9\) satisfies the condition that the circle intersects the axes at four points.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The equation of the circle is:
\[
(x + 2)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 9
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(x + 2)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 9}
\]
