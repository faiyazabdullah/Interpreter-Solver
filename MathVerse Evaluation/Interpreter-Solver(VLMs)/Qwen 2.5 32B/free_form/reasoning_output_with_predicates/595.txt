FINAL RESPONSE:

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the equation of a line that passes through the points \( (0, -5) \) and \( (5, 0) \). The given predicates and the image confirm these points lie on the line. The general form of a linear equation is \( y = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the predicates and the image:
1. The line passes through the points \( A = (0, -5) \) and \( B = (5, 0) \).
2. These points are explicitly given as \( Point(0, -5) \) and \( Point(5, 0) \).
3. The line is defined by these two points, and we need to find its equation in the form \( y = mx + b \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Calculate the Slope \( m \)
The slope \( m \) of a line passing through two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is given by:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
Substitute the coordinates of points \( A = (0, -5) \) and \( B = (5, 0) \):
\[
m = \frac{0 - (-5)}{5 - 0} = \frac{0 + 5}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1
\]
Thus, the slope \( m \) is \( 1 \).

#### Step 2.2: Determine the Y-Intercept \( b \)
The y-intercept \( b \) is the value of \( y \) when \( x = 0 \). From the point \( A = (0, -5) \), we see that when \( x = 0 \), \( y = -5 \). Therefore, the y-intercept \( b \) is \( -5 \).

#### Step 2.3: Write the Equation of the Line
Using the slope \( m = 1 \) and the y-intercept \( b = -5 \), the equation of the line in slope-intercept form \( y = mx + b \) is:
\[
y = 1 \cdot x - 5
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
y = x - 5
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The equation of the line that passes through the points \( (0, -5) \) and \( (5, 0) \) is:
\[
y = x - 5
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{y = x - 5}
\]
