QUESTION:
In a memory study, subjects are asked to memorize some content and recall as much as they can remember each day thereafter. Each day, Maximilian finds that he has forgotten $15 \%$ of what he could recount the day before. Lucy also took part in the study. The given graphs represent the percentage of content that Maximilian (gray) and Lucy (black) could remember after $t$ days. y-axis labels "days" and x-axis labels "recall percentage"

On each day, what percentage of the previous day's content did Lucy forget?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Analysis:
- The graph shows two curves representing the recall percentage over time (in days).
- The x-axis represents "days," and the y-axis represents "recall percentage."
- The black curve corresponds to Lucy, and the gray curve corresponds to Maximilian.
- Both curves start at 100% recall on day 0, indicating perfect initial recall.
- Over time, both curves decline, showing decreasing recall percentages.

#### Predicate Analysis:
- **PointLiesOnLine(Point(100), Line(recall percentage axis))**: The point (100, 0) lies on the recall percentage axis.
- **PointLiesOnLine(Point(0), Line(recall percentage axis))**: The origin (0, 0) lies on the recall percentage axis.
- **PointLiesOnLine(Point(0), Line(days axis))**: The origin (0, 0) lies on the days axis.
- **Perpendicular(Line(recall percentage axis), Line(days axis))**: The axes are perpendicular.
- **IsSideOf(Line(recall percentage axis), Shape(graph boundary))**: The recall percentage axis forms part of the boundary of the graph.
- **IsSideOf(Line(days axis), Shape(graph boundary))**: The days axis forms part of the boundary of the graph.

#### Key Observations:
- The question specifies that Maximilian forgets 15% of what he could recount the day before. This indicates an exponential decay model for his recall percentage.
- We need to determine the decay rate for Lucy, whose recall curve is represented by the black line.

#### Specific Question:
We are tasked with determining the percentage of the previous day's content that Lucy forgets each day.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Mathematical Model for Recall
The general form of an exponential decay function is:
\[
R(t) = R_0 \cdot (1 - r)^t
\]
where:
- \( R(t) \) is the recall percentage at day \( t \),
- \( R_0 \) is the initial recall percentage (100% in this case),
- \( r \) is the decay rate (proportion of content forgotten per day),
- \( t \) is the number of days.

For Maximilian:
- Maximilian forgets 15% of the content each day, so \( r = 0.15 \).
- His recall function is:
\[
R_{\text{Maximilian}}(t) = 100 \cdot (1 - 0.15)^t = 100 \cdot (0.85)^t
\]

For Lucy:
- Let \( r_L \) be the decay rate for Lucy.
- Her recall function is:
\[
R_{\text{Lucy}}(t) = 100 \cdot (1 - r_L)^t
\]

#### Step 2.2: Analyze the Graph
From the graph:
- Both curves start at 100% recall on day 0.
- The black curve (Lucy) decays more slowly than the gray curve (Maximilian), indicating a lower decay rate for Lucy compared to Maximilian.

#### Step 2.3: Determine Lucy's Decay Rate
To find \( r_L \), we need to compare the shapes of the curves. Since the problem does not provide specific numerical data points, we infer from the graph that Lucy's decay rate is less than Maximilian's decay rate of 0.15.

However, the exact decay rate can be deduced by observing the relative steepness of the curves. If Maximilian forgets 15% of the content each day, Lucy's slower decay implies she forgets less than 15%. By visually comparing the slopes, we can estimate her decay rate.

#### Step 2.4: Interpret the Slope
The slope of the black curve (Lucy) is less steep than the gray curve (Maximilian). This suggests that Lucy's decay rate is lower than 0.15. From the graph, it appears that Lucy's recall percentage decreases at a slower pace, indicating a decay rate closer to, but less than, 0.15.

#### Step 2.5: Quantitative Estimation
Without exact numerical data, we rely on the visual comparison. The black curve suggests that Lucy's decay rate is approximately half of Maximilian's decay rate. Therefore:
\[
r_L \approx \frac{0.15}{2} = 0.075
\]

Thus, Lucy forgets approximately 7.5% of the content each day.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

Based on the analysis, Lucy forgets approximately 7.5% of the content each day.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{7.5}\]
