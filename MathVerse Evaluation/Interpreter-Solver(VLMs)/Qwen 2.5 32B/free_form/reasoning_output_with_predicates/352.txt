QUESTION:
From the cockpit of an aeroplane flying at an altitude of 3000 m, the angle of depression to the airport is 57°. The aeroplane continues to fly in the same straight line, and after a few minutes the angle of depression to the airport becomes 67°.
Now find the distance between the two sightings.

Round your answer to the nearest metre.

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the distance between two points of observation from an airplane flying at a constant altitude of 3000 meters. The angles of depression change from \(57^\circ\) to \(67^\circ\) as the plane moves horizontally. The goal is to calculate the horizontal distance traveled by the plane between these two observations.

#### Key Information from the Problem:
1. **Altitude of the airplane**: \(3000\) meters.
2. **Angles of depression**: 
   - Initial angle of depression: \(57^\circ\).
   - Final angle of depression: \(67^\circ\).
3. **Geometric Setup**:
   - The airplane's path is horizontal, parallel to the ground.
   - The vertical distance from the airplane to the airport is constant at \(3000\) meters.
   - The problem involves right triangles formed by the airplane's position, the airport, and the horizontal distances.

#### Visual and Predicate Interpretation:
- The image shows two right triangles sharing the vertical side of length \(3000\) meters.
- The angles of depression correspond to the angles formed with the horizontal lines representing the airplane's flight path.
- The horizontal distances traveled by the airplane are labeled \(x\) and \(y\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Define Variables and Triangles**
Let:
- \(A\) be the initial position of the airplane.
- \(B\) be the final position of the airplane.
- \(C\) be the location of the airport.
- \(h = 3000\) meters be the altitude of the airplane.
- \(x\) be the horizontal distance from \(A\) to the projection of \(A\) onto the ground.
- \(y\) be the horizontal distance from \(B\) to the projection of \(B\) onto the ground.
- The total horizontal distance traveled by the airplane is \(x + y\).

From the given angles of depression:
- \(\angle ACB = 57^\circ\) (initial angle of depression).
- \(\angle BCB' = 67^\circ\) (final angle of depression), where \(B'\) is the projection of \(B\) onto the ground.

#### **Step 2: Use Trigonometry to Relate Distances and Angles**
In the right triangle \(ACB\):
\[ \tan(57^\circ) = \frac{h}{x} \implies x = \frac{h}{\tan(57^\circ)}. \]

In the right triangle \(BCB'\):
\[ \tan(67^\circ) = \frac{h}{y} \implies y = \frac{h}{\tan(67^\circ)}. \]

#### **Step 3: Calculate \(x\) and \(y\)**
Using the given altitude \(h = 3000\) meters:
\[ x = \frac{3000}{\tan(57^\circ)}, \]
\[ y = \frac{3000}{\tan(67^\circ)}. \]

First, compute \(\tan(57^\circ)\) and \(\tan(67^\circ)\):
\[ \tan(57^\circ) \approx 1.540, \]
\[ \tan(67^\circ) \approx 2.356. \]

Now, substitute these values into the expressions for \(x\) and \(y\):
\[ x = \frac{3000}{1.540} \approx 1948.05 \text{ meters}, \]
\[ y = \frac{3000}{2.356} \approx 1273.00 \text{ meters}. \]

#### **Step 4: Find the Total Horizontal Distance**
The total horizontal distance traveled by the airplane is:
\[ x + y = 1948.05 + 1273.00 = 3221.05 \text{ meters}. \]

#### **Step 5: Round to the Nearest Meter**
Rounding \(3221.05\) to the nearest meter gives:
\[ x + y \approx 3221 \text{ meters}. \]

### Final Answer:
\[ \boxed{3221} \]
