QUESTION:
The graph, which is a piecewise function and passes through the origin, shows Jimmy's speed while he is competing in a bike race, the x-axis representing Time and the y-axis representing Speed. Which situation corresponds to the graph?

A:Jimmy starts off by increasing his pace gradually and then stops as he trips over a stick,but then recovers and is able to increase his speed until the end of the race
B:Jimmy starts off at a constant speed and then increases his speed at a steady rate
C:Jimmy starts off by increasing his pace gradually and then maintains a constant speed
D:Jimmy hits his maximum speed about halfway through the race
