QUESTION:
The graph of a cubic function  f  is shown in Figure 18 with a labeled point (1.333, 5.185) at its right part. Based on the calculator screen shot, the point  (1.333,5.185)  is which of the following?

CHOICES:
A.a relative (local) maximum of the function
B.the vertex of the function
C.the absolute maximum of the function
D.a zero of the function

====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given information and the image step by step.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- The image shows a point labeled as (X, Y).
- X = 1.3333324 and Y = 5.1851852.
- There is a label "Maximum" near the point (X, Y).
- The lines X and Y are perpendicular to each other.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify the Point (X, Y):**
   - The coordinates (X, Y) are given as (1.3333324, 5.1851852).
   - These coordinates correspond to the point on the curve in the image.

2. **Interpret the Label "Maximum":**
   - The label "Maximum" suggests that the point (X, Y) represents the highest point on the curve in the region of interest.

3. **Analyze the Perpendicular Lines:**
   - The lines X and Y are perpendicular to each other, but this does not directly affect the determination of the nature of the point (X, Y).

4. **Consider the Options:**
   - **A. Relative (Local) Maximum**: This means it is the highest point within a certain neighborhood of the curve.
   - **B. Vertex of the Function**: In general, a vertex refers to a critical point where the derivative changes sign.
   - **C. Absolute Maximum**: This would be the highest point on the entire curve.
   - **D. Zero of the Function**: This would be a point where the function crosses the x-axis.

Given the label "Maximum," we know the point (X, Y) is a local maximum because it is labeled as such, and there is no indication that it is the absolute maximum over the entire domain of the function.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
- Since the point (X, Y) is labeled as a maximum and the context suggests it is a local maximum rather than the absolute maximum, the correct answer is:
  - **Final Answer: A**
