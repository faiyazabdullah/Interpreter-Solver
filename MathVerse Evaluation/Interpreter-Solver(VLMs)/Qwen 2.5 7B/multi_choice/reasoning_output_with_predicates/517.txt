Let's analyze the given problem step-by-step using the provided geometric information and the characteristics of exponential functions.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- We have two graphs showing the functions \( y = 4^x \) and \( y = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^x \).
- The graph \( y = 4^x \) represents an exponential function with base 4, which increases rapidly as \( x \) increases.
- The graph \( y = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^x \) also represents an exponential function but with base \(\frac{1}{4}\), which decreases as \( x \) increases.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
- The rate of change of an exponential function \( y = a^x \) is proportional to its current value \( y \). Specifically, the derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) of \( y = a^x \) is given by \( \frac{dy}{dx} = a^x \ln(a) \).
- For \( y = 4^x \), the rate of change is \( \frac{dy}{dx} = 4^x \ln(4) \).
- Since \( \ln(4) > 0 \), the rate of change \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) is positive for all \( x \), indicating that \( y = 4^x \) is always increasing.
- Importantly, the rate of change \( \frac{dy}{dx} = 4^x \ln(4) \) itself increases as \( x \) increases because \( 4^x \) grows exponentially. This means the function is increasing at an increasing rate.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
- Based on the deduction above, the function \( y = 4^x \) is increasing at an increasing rate.

Therefore, the correct choice is:
