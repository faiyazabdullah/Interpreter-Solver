QUESTION:
The logarithm function and a line are graphed. Logarithm function $f$ is graphed in blue and it goes through (30,4), (5,2), (55,5). Line $y=4$ is graphed in red and parallel to x-axis. A pharmaceutical scientist making a new medication wonders how much of the active ingredient to include in a dose. They are curious how long different amounts of the active ingredient will stay in someone's bloodstream.

The amount of time (in hours) the active ingredient remains in the bloodstream can be modeled by $f(x)=-1.25 \cdot \ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$, where $x$ is the initial amount of the active ingredient (in milligrams). Here is the graph of $f$ and the graph of the line $y=4$.

Which statements represent the meaning of the intersection point of the graphs?

Choose all answers that apply:

CHOICES:
A:It describes the amount of time the active ingredient stays in the bloodstream if the initial amount of the active ingredient is $4 \mathrm{mg}$.
B:
C:It gives the solution to the equation $-1.25 \cdot \ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)=4$.
D:It describes the situation where the initial amount of the active ingredient is equal to how long it stays in the bloodstream.
E:
F:It gives the initial amount of the active ingredient such that the last of the active ingredient leaves the bloodstream after 4 hours.

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given graph and the function \( f(x) = -1.25 \cdot \ln \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \).

### Step 1: Identify the Intersection Point
The intersection point of the curve \( f(x) \) and the horizontal line \( y = 4 \) represents the value of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 4 \).

From the graph, we see that the curve intersects the line \( y = 4 \) at \( x = 30 \). This means:
\[ f(30) = 4 \]

### Step 2: Interpret the Meaning of the Intersection Point
The intersection point indicates the following:
- It describes the amount of time the active ingredient stays in the bloodstream if the initial amount of the active ingredient is \( 4 \) mg.
- It gives the solution to the equation \( -1.25 \cdot \ln \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = 4 \).
- It describes the situation where the initial amount of the active ingredient is equal to how long it stays in the bloodstream.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Statements
Let's evaluate each statement:
- **A**: It describes the amount of time the active ingredient stays in the bloodstream if the initial amount of the active ingredient is \( 4 \) mg.
  - Correct because the intersection point at \( x = 30 \) implies that when the initial amount is \( 4 \) mg, the time it stays in the bloodstream is \( 30 \) hours.
  
- **B**: It gives the solution to the equation \( -1.25 \cdot \ln \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = 4 \).
  - Correct because the intersection point satisfies the equation, so the value \( x = 30 \) is a solution.

- **C**: It describes the situation where the initial amount of the active ingredient is equal to how long it stays in the bloodstream.
  - Correct because the intersection point at \( x = 30 \) means that if the initial amount is \( 4 \) mg, the time it stays in the bloodstream is \( 30 \) hours.

- **D**: It gives the initial amount of the active ingredient such that the last of the active ingredient leaves the bloodstream after 4 hours.
  - Incorrect because the intersection point does not directly relate to the time until the last of the active ingredient leaves the bloodstream; it only provides the time for a given initial amount.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
