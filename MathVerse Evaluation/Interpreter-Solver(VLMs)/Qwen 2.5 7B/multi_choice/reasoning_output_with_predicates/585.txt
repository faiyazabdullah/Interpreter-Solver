QUESTION:
Do the following graph, which is a curve passes (0,1) and when the value of x increases the value of y increases, have inverse functions?

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

====================================================================================================
QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To determine if the function represented by the curve has an inverse, we need to check two main conditions:

1. The function must be one-to-one (injective).
2. The function must be onto (surjective).

From the image and given predicates, let's analyze these conditions step-by-step:

### Step 1: Check Injectivity
For a function to be injective, it must pass the horizontal line test. This means that any horizontal line intersects the curve at most once.

- From the image, the curve appears to be increasing and does not intersect itself horizontally. This suggests the curve might be one-to-one.

### Step 2: Check Surjectivity
For a function to be surjective, the range of the function must include all possible values of \(y\). The image shows that the curve extends indefinitely upwards, suggesting it covers all positive \(y\) values.

Given these observations:
- The curve looks like it is increasing without repetition (injective).
- The curve covers all positive \(y\) values (onto).

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since the curve seems to be one-to-one and onto, it implies that the function defined by the curve is bijective (both one-to-one and onto). Therefore, it should have an inverse.
