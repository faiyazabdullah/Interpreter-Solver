QUESTION:
The graph with 2 linear functions shows the progress of two competitors in a cycling race. In the graph, the x-axis represents Time and the y-axis represents Distance.

Who is traveling faster?

CHOICES:
A:Justin
B:Oliver

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To determine who is traveling faster, we need to compare the slopes of the lines representing Oliver's and Justin's progress in the graph.

**Step 1: Identify the slopes of the lines**

The slope of a line in a distance-time graph represents the speed of the competitor. The formula for the slope \( m \) is:
\[ m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \]

For Oliver's line:
- The line passes through points \((0, 0)\) and \((5, 175)\).
- The change in distance (\(\Delta y\)) is \(175 - 0 = 175\).
- The change in time (\(\Delta x\)) is \(5 - 0 = 5\).
- Therefore, the slope for Oliver is:
\[ m_{\text{Oliver}} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \]

For Justin's line:
- The line passes through points \((0, 0)\) and \((5, 125)\).
- The change in distance (\(\Delta y\)) is \(125 - 0 = 125\).
- The change in time (\(\Delta x\)) is \(5 - 0 = 5\).
- Therefore, the slope for Justin is:
\[ m_{\text{Justin}} = \frac{125}{5} = 25 \]

**Step 2: Compare the slopes**

The slope of Oliver's line is 35, and the slope of Justin's line is 25. Since a higher slope indicates a faster speed, Oliver has a greater slope than Justin.

**Conclusion:**

Oliver is traveling faster.
