QUESTION:
g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function opening upward and goes through (-3,0) and (4,0). f(x)=x^2+4x. How many roots do the functions have in common?

CHOICES:
A:$f$ and $g$ share the same root(s).
B:$f$ and $g$ share one root in common but each have another root that is not shared.
C:$f$ and $g$ share no roots in common.

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

From the given predicates:
- \( g(x) = (x + 3)(x - 4) \)
- \( g(x) \) opens upward, indicating it has roots at \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 4 \).

From the visual information in the graph:
- The roots of \( g(x) \) are clearly marked at \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 4 \).

From the predicates:
- \( f(x) = x^2 + 4x \)
- The roots of \( f(x) \) are found by setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
  \[
  x^2 + 4x = 0 \implies x(x + 4) = 0
  \]
  Therefore, the roots are \( x = 0 \) and \( x = -4 \).

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. From the graph and the predicates, we see that \( g(x) \) has roots at \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 4 \).
2. From the predicates, we know that \( f(x) \) has roots at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = -4 \).
3. Comparing these roots, we see that there are no common roots between \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

Since \( g(x) \) and \( f(x) \) do not share any common roots, the correct answer is:
