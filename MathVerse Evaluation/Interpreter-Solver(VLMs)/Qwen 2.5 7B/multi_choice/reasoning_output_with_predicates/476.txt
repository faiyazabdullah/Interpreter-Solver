QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- The image shows two curves that appear to be reflections of each other across the x-axis.
- The given predicate "Symmetrical(Curve1, Curve2, Line(x))" indicates that Curve1 and Curve2 are symmetric about the x-axis.
- To determine if the relation is a function, we use the vertical line test: for each x-value, there should be only one corresponding y-value.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**
- Since Curve1 and Curve2 are symmetric about the x-axis, any point (x, y) on Curve1 will have a corresponding point (x, -y) on Curve2.
- This symmetry implies that for any x, the y-values are either y or -y, which means for some x, there are multiple y-values.
- According to the vertical line test, a relation is a function if each x-value corresponds to exactly one y-value.
- Here, since some x-values correspond to two y-values (one positive and one negative), the relation is not a function.

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
- Based on the vertical line test, the relation is not a function.
- Final Answer: B
