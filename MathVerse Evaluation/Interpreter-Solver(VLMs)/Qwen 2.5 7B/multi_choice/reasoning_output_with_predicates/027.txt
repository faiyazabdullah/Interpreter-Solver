QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, when planting trees on flat ground, the plant spacing (the horizontal distance between two adjacent trees) is required to be 4.0. If trees are planted on a hillside with a slope of 0.75, and the plant spacing is also required to be 4.0, then the slope distance between two adjacent trees is ()

B:6m
C:7m
D:8m

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- The horizontal distance between two adjacent trees on flat ground is given as 4.0 units.
- The slope of the hill is specified as 0.75, which means for every 1 unit of vertical rise, there are 0.75 units of horizontal run.
- We need to find the slope distance between two adjacent trees when the plant spacing remains 4.0 units horizontally but the terrain is sloped.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**
1. From the given ratio, if the horizontal run is 4.0 units, then the vertical rise would be \( 4.0 \times 0.75 = 3.0 \) units.
2. The slope distance (\(d\)) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, where the slope distance is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with the vertical rise and horizontal run as the legs.
   \[
   d = \sqrt{(4.0)^2 + (3.0)^2} = \sqrt{16.0 + 9.0} = \sqrt{25.0} = 5.0
   \]

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
The slope distance between two adjacent trees is 5.0 units.
