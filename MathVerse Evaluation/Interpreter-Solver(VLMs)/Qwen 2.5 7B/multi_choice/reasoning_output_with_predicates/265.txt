QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the given information and logical deductions.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
We are given the following:
- \(m \angle 4 = 2x + 23\)
- \(m \angle 5 = 7x - 5\)
- The sum of these angles is 180 degrees because they are supplementary angles formed by a transversal cutting parallel lines.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. Since lines \(l\) and \(m\) are parallel, and line \(p\) is a transversal, the corresponding angles are equal.
2. Therefore, the angles on the same side of the transversal but inside the parallel lines (angles 4 and 5) are supplementary, meaning their measures add up to 180 degrees.
3. We set up the equation:
   \[
   (2x + 23) + (7x - 5) = 180
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2x + 7x + 23 - 5 = 180
   \]
   \[
   9x + 18 = 180
   \]
5. Subtract 18 from both sides:
   \[
   9x = 162
   \]
6. Divide by 9:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

### Conclusion and Selection
The value of \(x\) is 18.
