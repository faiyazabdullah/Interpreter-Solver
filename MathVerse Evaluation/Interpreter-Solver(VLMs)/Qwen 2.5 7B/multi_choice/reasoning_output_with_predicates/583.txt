QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

- The graph shows a line passing through points \( A = (-6, 0) \) and \( B = (0, 2) \).
- The line has a positive slope.
- The question asks whether the line has an inverse function.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. **Identify the slope of the line:**
   - Slope \( m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{2 - 0}{0 - (-6)} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \).
   - Since the slope is positive, the line is increasing.

2. **Determine if the function is one-to-one:**
   - For a line to have an inverse function, it must be one-to-one (injective), meaning it does not intersect itself.
   - A linear function \( y = mx + b \) is one-to-one if its slope \( m \neq 0 \).
   - Here, the slope \( m = \frac{1}{3} \neq 0 \), so the line is one-to-one.

3. **Conclusion about the inverse function:**
   - Since the line is one-to-one, it has an inverse function.

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

- Final Answer: A
