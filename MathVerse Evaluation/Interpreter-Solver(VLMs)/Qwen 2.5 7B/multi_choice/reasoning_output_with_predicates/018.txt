QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

- We have two parallel lines \(a\) and \(b\).
- Angles \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) are both 58 degrees.
- Angle \(\angle 3\) is 70 degrees.
- We need to find the measure of \(\angle 4\).

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. Since \(a\) and \(b\) are parallel, and line \(d\) is transversal, \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) are corresponding angles. Thus, they are congruent.
2. According to the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem, \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle 4\) are also corresponding angles because they are formed by the same transversal cutting two parallel lines.
3. Therefore, \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle 4\) are congruent.

Given:
- MeasureOf(\(\angle 3\)) = 70.0

By the Corresponding Angles Postulate:
- MeasureOf(\(\angle 4\)) = MeasureOf(\(\angle 3\)) = 70.0

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

Final Answer: B
