QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, in order to measure the degree of tree AB, a certain mathematics learning interest group measured the length of the tree's shadow BC in the sun as 9.0. At the same moment, they also measured the shadow length of Xiaoliang in the sun as 1.5. Knowing that Xiaoliang's height is 1.8, then the height of tree AB is ()

CHOICES:
A:10.8m
B:9m
C:7.5m
D:0.3m

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to use the concept of similar triangles. The triangles formed by the tree and its shadow, and the person and their shadow are similar because the sun's rays are parallel.

Given:
- Length of tree shadow \( BC = 9 \) meters.
- Length of person's shadow \( DE = 1.5 \) meters.
- Height of person \( BE = 1.8 \) meters.

Let the height of the tree \( AB = h \) meters.

Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
\[
\frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{BE}{DE}
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
\frac{h}{9} = \frac{1.8}{1.5}
\]

Now, solve for \( h \):
\[
h = 9 \times \frac{1.8}{1.5}
\]

Calculate the ratio:
\[
\frac{1.8}{1.5} = 1.2
\]

Thus:
\[
h = 9 \times 1.2 = 10.8
\]

Therefore, the height of the tree \( AB \) is \( 10.8 \) meters.

Final Answer: A
