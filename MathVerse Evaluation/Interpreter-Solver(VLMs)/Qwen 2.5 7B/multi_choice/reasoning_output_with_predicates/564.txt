====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- We have two functions: \( g(x) \) and \( f(x) = 4(x-5)^2 + 2 \).
- \( g(x) \) is a quadratic function with its vertex at \( (-2, 3) \).
- The points \( (0, 7) \) and \( (-4, 7) \) lie on the graph of \( g(x) \).

### Step 2: Determine the general form of \( g(x) \)
Since \( g(x) \) is a quadratic function, it can be written in the vertex form:
\[ g(x) = a(x + 2)^2 + 3 \]

We know two points on the graph:
- \( (0, 7) \)
- \( (-4, 7) \)

Substitute these points into the vertex form to find \( a \):

For \( (0, 7) \):
\[ 7 = a(0 + 2)^2 + 3 \]
\[ 7 = 4a + 3 \]
\[ 4a = 4 \]
\[ a = 1 \]

So, the equation of \( g(x) \) is:
\[ g(x) = (x + 2)^2 + 3 \]

### Step 3: Compare the minimum values of \( g(x) \) and \( f(x) \)
- For \( g(x) \), the minimum value occurs at the vertex \( (-2, 3) \). Thus, the minimum value of \( g(x) \) is 3.
- For \( f(x) \), the function is \( f(x) = 4(x-5)^2 + 2 \). The minimum value occurs at the vertex \( (5, 2) \). Thus, the minimum value of \( f(x) \) is 2.

### Step 4: Conclusion
The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is less than the minimum value of \( g(x) \). Therefore, \( g(x) \) has a greater minimum.
