QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- The given graph shows a curve approaching the x-axis but never touching it, indicating a horizontal asymptote at y = 0.
- The vertical line x = 4 appears to be a vertical asymptote for the curve.
- The function is likely of the form \( f(x) = \frac{k}{x - 4} \) for some constant k.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**
- The function \( f(x) = \frac{k}{x - 4} \) is a rational function with a vertical asymptote at \( x = 4 \).
- To check if this function has an inverse, we need to see if it is one-to-one. A function is one-to-one if it passes the Horizontal Line Test.
- For the function \( f(x) = \frac{k}{x - 4} \), as \( x \) approaches 4 from the left or right, \( f(x) \) approaches negative infinity and positive infinity respectively.
- As \( x \) moves away from 4, \( f(x) \) increases without bound if \( k > 0 \) or decreases without bound if \( k < 0 \).
- Therefore, the function \( f(x) = \frac{k}{x - 4} \) passes the Horizontal Line Test because no horizontal line will intersect the curve more than once.
- Since the function is one-to-one, it has an inverse function.

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
- Final Answer: A
