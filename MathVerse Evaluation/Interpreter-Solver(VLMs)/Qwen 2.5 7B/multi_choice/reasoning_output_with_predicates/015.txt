QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- The line \(a\) and line \(b\) are parallel.
- The line \(c\) intersects both lines \(a\) and \(b\) at point \(A\).
- Line \(b\) is perpendicular to line \(c\).
- Angle \(1\) measures \(70^\circ\).

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. Since \(b \parallel a\), the alternate interior angles formed by the transversal \(c\) will be equal.
2. Because \(b\) is perpendicular to \(c\), the angle between \(b\) and \(c\) is \(90^\circ\).
3. Point \(A\) lies on both lines \(b\) and \(c\), so the angle between \(b\) and \(c\) at \(A\) is \(90^\circ\).
4. Given that the angle \(1\) is \(70^\circ\), this forms one side of the right triangle with the other being the perpendicular \(90^\circ\).
5. Therefore, the rotation needed to align \(b\) with \(a\) while keeping \(c\) perpendicular would be the difference between \(90^\circ\) and \(70^\circ\).

**Calculation:**
\[ 90^\circ - 70^\circ = 20^\circ \]

**Conclusion and Selection:**
The line \(b\) can be rotated \(20^\circ\) clockwise around the point \(A\).
