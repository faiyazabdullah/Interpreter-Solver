QUESTION:
Kai is swinging on a trapeze in a circus show. The horizontal distance between Kai and the edge of the stage, in meters, is modeled by $D(t)$ where $t$ is the time in seconds. The function is graphed below, along with one segment highlighted, a red double arrow from (5,21) to (15,21). What is the meaning of the highlighted segment?

CHOICES:
A:Kai completes 10 swing cycles per second.
B:The trapeze is hung $\mathbf{1 0}$ meters from the edge of the stage.
C:Kai completes a single swing cycle in 10 seconds.
D:The trapeze is $\mathbf{1 0}$ meters long.

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

From the image, we observe two points labeled \( A \) and \( B \) on the curve. Point \( A \) has coordinates \( (5, 21) \) and point \( B \) has coordinates \( (15, 21) \). Both points lie on the function \( D(t) \). The horizontal distance \( y \) between these points is constant at 21, and their respective times \( t \) are 5 and 15 seconds. The length of the line segment \( AB \) is given as 10 meters.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

- Since \( y(A) = y(B) = 21 \), the vertical distance between points \( A \) and \( B \) is 0. This means the points lie directly above or below each other horizontally.
- The horizontal distance between points \( A \) and \( B \) is 10 meters, which corresponds to the length of the line segment \( AB \).
- The time difference between points \( A \) and \( B \) is 10 seconds (from \( t(A) = 5 \) to \( t(B) = 15 \)).
- Therefore, the highlighted segment represents the duration of one complete swing cycle of Kai, since the horizontal distance remains constant during this period.

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

The highlighted segment indicates that Kai completes a single swing cycle in 10 seconds.
