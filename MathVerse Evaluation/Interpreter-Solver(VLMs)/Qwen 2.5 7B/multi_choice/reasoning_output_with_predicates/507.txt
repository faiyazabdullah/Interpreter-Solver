QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the given points and intercepts:**
   - The y-intercept is 3, so the line passes through the point \( (0, 3) \).
   - The x-intercept is -8, so the line passes through the point \( (-8, 0) \).

2. **Determine the slope of the line:**
   The slope \( m \) of a line passing through two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is given by:
   \[
   m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
   \]
   Substituting the points \( (0, 3) \) and \( (-8, 0) \):
   \[
   m = \frac{0 - 3}{-8 - 0} = \frac{-3}{-8} = \frac{3}{8}
   \]

3. **Write the equation of the line in slope-intercept form:**
   The slope-intercept form of a line is \( y = mx + b \), where \( b \) is the y-intercept.
   Here, \( b = 3 \) and \( m = \frac{3}{8} \):
   \[
   y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3
   \]

4. **Convert the slope-intercept form to standard form:**
   The standard form of a line is \( Ax + By = C \). To convert \( y = \frac{3}{8}x + 3 \) to standard form:
   \[
   y - \frac{3}{8}x = 3
   \]
   Multiply through by 8 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   8y - 3x = 24
   \]
   Rearrange to match one of the choices:
   \[
   3x + 8y = 24
   \]

5. **Compare with the given choices:**
   - Choice A: \( 3x - 8y = 24 \)
   - Choice B: \( 3x - 8y = -24 \)
   - Choice C: \( 3x + 8y = 24 \)
   - Choice D: \( 3x + 8y = -24 \)

The correct equation is \( 3x + 8y = 24 \).

Final Answer: C
