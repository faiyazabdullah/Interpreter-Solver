QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

- The image shows two rulers intersecting at point $1$ forming a right angle ($90^\circ$).
- Angle $1$ is given as $40^\circ$.
- Triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with a right angle at vertex $B$.
- We need to find the measure of angle $2$.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. Since triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with a right angle at $B$, the sum of the other two angles must be $90^\circ$. Therefore, angle $1 +$ angle $2 = 90^\circ$.
2. Given that angle $1 = 40^\circ$, substituting this into the equation gives us $40^\circ +$ angle $2 = 90^\circ$.
3. Solving for angle $2$, we get angle $2 = 90^\circ - 40^\circ = 50^\circ$.
4. However, angle $2$ appears to be an exterior angle to the right triangle formed by the intersection of the rulers. The exterior angle of a triangle is supplementary to its adjacent interior angle. Thus, the measure of angle $2$ should be $180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ$.

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
