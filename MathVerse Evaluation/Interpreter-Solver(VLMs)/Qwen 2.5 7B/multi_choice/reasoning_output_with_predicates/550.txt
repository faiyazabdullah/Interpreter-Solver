QUESTION:
Elena knows that Lea has a garden with an area of 100 square meters. She does not know the specific width, $w$, and length, $l$ of the garden. The graph below represents the widths that correspond to possible lengths of Lea's garden, which decreases when $w$ increases and goes through (5,20), (10,10), (20,5). As the possible width of Lea's garden increases, what does its possible length approach?

CHOICES:
A:$\infty$
B:$\hline 0$
C:$\hline 10$
D:$\hline 120$

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- The given graph shows a curve representing the relationship between the width \( w \) and the length \( l \).
- The curve passes through points (5,20), (10,10), and (20,5).
- The area of the garden is fixed at 100 square meters.
- The graph shows that as \( w \) increases, \( l \) approaches a certain limit.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**
- Since the area of the garden is fixed at 100 square meters, we have the equation \( l \times w = 100 \).
- From the graph, as \( w \) increases, \( l \) decreases.
- The points on the curve suggest a hyperbolic relationship between \( l \) and \( w \).

Given the points:
- When \( w = 5 \), \( l = 20 \).
- When \( w = 10 \), \( l = 10 \).
- When \( w = 20 \), \( l = 5 \).

We can infer that the curve \( l = \frac{100}{w} \) describes the relationship between \( l \) and \( w \). As \( w \) approaches infinity, \( l \) approaches 0.

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
- According to the graph and the relationship derived from the points, as \( w \) increases without bound, \( l \) approaches 0.
- Therefore, the correct choice is B.
