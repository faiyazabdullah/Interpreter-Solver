QUESTION:
Do the following graph, which is a curve passes (-1,0), (0,8), (2,0), (4,0), have inverse functions?

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To determine if the given function has an inverse, we need to check if it is one-to-one (injective). A function is one-to-one if every element in the domain maps to a unique element in the codomain, and no two different elements in the domain map to the same element in the codomain.

From the image and the given points, the function appears to cross the x-axis more than once between the points (0, 8) and (2, 0), specifically around the point (4, 0). This means there are multiple x-values that map to the same y-value, indicating that the function is not one-to-one.

For a function to have an inverse, it must be one-to-one. Since the function is not one-to-one, it does not have an inverse.
