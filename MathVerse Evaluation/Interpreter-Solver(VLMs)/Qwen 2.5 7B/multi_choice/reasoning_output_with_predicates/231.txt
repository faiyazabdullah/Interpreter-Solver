QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

From the given predicates:
- Points \(Z\), \(Y\), \(V\), and \(W\) lie on the circle \(\odot X\).
- Line segments \(ZW\) and \(YV\) are diameters of the circle \(\odot X\).

From the given angle measures:
- \(\angle YXW = 4x + 15^\circ\).
- \(\angle ZXV = 2x + 65^\circ\).

We need to find the measure of \(\angle VXW\).

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

Since \(ZW\) and \(YV\) are diameters, they subtend right angles at points \(Y\), \(Z\), \(V\), and \(W\) respectively. Therefore:
- \(\angle YXW\) and \(\angle ZXV\) are inscribed angles that intercept semicircles.

Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts, we have:
- \(\angle YXW\) intercepts the arc \(YW\).
- \(\angle ZXV\) intercepts the arc \(ZV\).

Given \(\angle YXW = 4x + 15^\circ\) and \(\angle ZXV = 2x + 65^\circ\):
- Since these angles intercept arcs that sum up to a semicircle, their measures must satisfy:
\[4x + 15 = 2x + 65.\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[4x + 15 = 2x + 65,\]
\[4x - 2x = 65 - 15,\]
\[2x = 50,\]
\[x = 25.\]

Substituting \(x = 25\) back into the expressions for the angles:
- \(\angle YXW = 4(25) + 15 = 100 + 15 = 115^\circ\).
- \(\angle ZXV = 2(25) + 65 = 50 + 65 = 115^\circ\).

Since \(ZW\) and \(YV\) are diameters, \(\angle VXW\) is a right angle because it is subtended by a diameter:
\[m\angle VXW = 90^\circ.\]

However, since the problem specifies the angles and we have derived consistent values, we should check if there's a simpler relationship directly related to the given options.

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

Given the derived values and the options provided:
- The closest match to the derived right angle is not listed directly but fits within the context of the problem constraints.
