QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve for \(x^2 + y^2\) in the given right triangles, let's analyze the geometric setup step-by-step using the provided predicates and the Pythagorean theorem.

**Step 1: Identify the triangles and their properties**
- Triangle T1 has legs \(\sqrt{3}\) and \(\sqrt{3}\), so its hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{(\sqrt{3})^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{6}\).
- Triangle T2 has legs \(\sqrt{10}\) and \(\sqrt{7}\), so its hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{(\sqrt{10})^2 + (\sqrt{7})^2} = \sqrt{10 + 7} = \sqrt{17}\).
- Triangle T3 has legs 2 and \(\sqrt{6}\), so its hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{2^2 + (\sqrt{6})^2} = \sqrt{4 + 6} = \sqrt{10}\).
- Triangle T4 has legs \(x\) and \(y\), so its hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).

**Step 2: Determine the relationships between the triangles**
- The hypotenuse of T1 and T3 meet at a point where they form a right angle, implying the sum of their legs forms the leg of another triangle.
- The hypotenuse of T2 and T4 meet at a point where they form a right angle, implying the sum of their legs forms the leg of another triangle.
- Since the triangles are arranged such that the hypotenuse of one triangle is a leg of the next, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the sides.

**Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem**
- For the larger triangle formed by the hypotenuses of T2 and T4, the legs are \(\sqrt{17}\) and \(\sqrt{10}\), and the hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). Therefore, \((\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})^2 = (\sqrt{17})^2 + (\sqrt{10})^2 = 17 + 10 = 27\). Thus, \(x^2 + y^2 = 27\).
