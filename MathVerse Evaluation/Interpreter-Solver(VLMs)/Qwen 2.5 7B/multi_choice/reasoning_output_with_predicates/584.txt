QUESTION:
Do the following graph, which is a parabola passing (0,2) and it opens upwards, have inverse functions?

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

====================================================================================================
QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- The graph shows a parabola passing through the point (0,2).
- The parabola opens upwards.
- The vertex form of a parabola that opens upwards and passes through (0,2) suggests a minimum at y=2.
- For a function to have an inverse, it must be one-to-one, meaning it should pass the horizontal line test.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**
- Since the parabola opens upwards, it will have a minimum point at x=0, where y=2.
- A parabola that opens upwards will have two points on either side of its vertex where the same y-value occurs, making it fail the horizontal line test.
- Therefore, the function does not satisfy the conditions to have an inverse function.

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
- The parabola fails the horizontal line test, so it does not have an inverse function.
