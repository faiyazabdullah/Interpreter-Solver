QUESTION:
Ashlynn models the relationship between the temperature $C$ of a hot cup of tea (in degrees Celsius) and time $T$ since the tea was poured into the cup (in minutes) as $C=20+20 \cdot 0.88^T$. The temperature decreases when time increases, and passes points(0, 40). She wanted to graph the relationship over the first half hour. Here is her work: What mistakes did Ashlynn make when drawing the graph?

CHOICES:
A:Inappropriate scale for $x$-axis
B:Inappropriate scale for $y$-axis
C:Wrong/missing label for $x$-axis
D:Wrong/missing label for $y$-axis
E:Ashlynn didn't make any mistake

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given graph and the relationship described by Ashlynn's function \(C = 20 + 20 \cdot 0.88^T\).

1. **Identify the Key Points**: The graph shows the temperature \(C\) decreasing over time \(T\), starting at 40°C at \(T = 0\) and approaching a horizontal asymptote near 20°C.
2. **Compare with the Function**: The function \(C = 20 + 20 \cdot 0.88^T\) also starts at 40°C at \(T = 0\) and decreases exponentially to approach 20°C.
3. **Graph Analysis**:
   - The graph shows a smooth curve that starts at 40°C and gradually decreases.
   - The asymptotic behavior matches the exponential decay part of the function.
4. **Scale Check**:
   - The x-axis is labeled "Time (minutes)" which ranges from 0 to 30.
   - The y-axis is labeled "Temperature (degrees Celsius)" which ranges from 0 to 40.
5. **Label Check**:
   - The x-axis is correctly labeled as "Time (minutes)".
   - The y-axis is correctly labeled as "Temperature (degrees Celsius)".

Given these observations, there are no apparent mistakes in the scale or labels of the graph. The graph accurately represents the function and its behavior over the given range.
