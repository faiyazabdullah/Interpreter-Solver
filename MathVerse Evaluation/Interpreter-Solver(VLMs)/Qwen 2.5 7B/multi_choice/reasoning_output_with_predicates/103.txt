QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- Points A, B, and C lie on circle O.
- Angle ABC measures 130 degrees.
- Line OA and OC are radii of the circle, meaning they are equal in length.
- We need to find the measure of angle AOC.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**
1. Since angle ABC is given as 130 degrees, we know that angle AOC is twice angle ABC because the central angle is twice the inscribed angle that subtends the same arc.
2. This relationship comes directly from the Inscribed Angle Theorem which states that the measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle that subtends the same arc.
3. Therefore, MeasureOf(Angle(AOC)) = 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(ABC)).
4. Substituting the given value:
   MeasureOf(Angle(AOC)) = 2 * 130.0 = 260.0 degrees.

However, this calculation seems incorrect because the sum of angles around point O should not exceed 360 degrees. Let's re-evaluate the problem considering the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees.

5. Since A, B, and C lie on the circle, and angle ABC is 130 degrees, the remaining angle at point O would be supplementary to angle ABC in the cyclic quadrilateral ABOC. Therefore, angle AOC should be supplementary to angle ABC but also twice the inscribed angle subtending the same arc.
6. Correctly, the central angle AOC is indeed twice the inscribed angle ABC, but considering the full circle, we need to find the correct supplementary angle:
   MeasureOf(Angle(AOC)) = 360 - 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(ABC)) = 360 - 2 * 130 = 100 degrees.

Thus, the correct measure of angle AOC is 100 degrees.

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
Final Answer: A
