QUESTION:
A polynomial $p$ is graphed, which goes through (-2.5,0), (-1,0), (3,0). What could be the equation of $p$ ?

CHOICES:
A:$p(x)=(x+1)^2(2 x+5)^2(x-3)^2$
B:$p(x)=(x+1)^2(2 x+5)(x-3)^2$
C:$p(x)=(x+1)^2(2 x+5)(x-3)$
D:$p(x)=(x+1)(2 x+5)(x-3)^2$

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

- The polynomial \( p \) is given to pass through the points \((-2.5, 0)\), \((-1, 0)\), and \((3, 0)\).
- These points are roots of the polynomial, meaning they can be expressed as factors of the form \((x + a)\), where \(a\) is the root's negative value.
- From the image, it appears that the polynomial has a double root at \(x = -1\) because the curve touches the x-axis there and does not cross it.
- The polynomial also seems to have a double root at \(x = 3\) due to the same behavior observed at \(x = 3\).
- The factor corresponding to \(x = -2.5\) can be represented as \((2x + 5)\).

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

- The polynomial must be of the form \((x + 1)^2(2x + 5)(x - 3)^2\) because:
  - It has double roots at \(x = -1\) and \(x = 3\).
  - It crosses the x-axis at \(x = -2.5\), indicating \((2x + 5)\).

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

- The polynomial equation that fits all these conditions is \(p(x) = (x + 1)^2(2x + 5)(x - 3)^2\).
