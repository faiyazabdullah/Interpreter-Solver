QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the light source P is directly above the crossbar AB, the shadow of AB under the light is CD, AB parallel  CD, AB = 2.0, CD = 5.0, the distance between point P and CD is 3.0, then the distance between AB and CD is ().

CHOICES:
A:\frac{6}{5}
B:\frac{7}{6}
C:\frac{9}{5}
D:\frac{15}{2}

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- Point P is directly above AB, making APB and CPD similar triangles due to the parallel lines and the fact that they share the same angle at P.
- AB = 2.0, CD = 5.0, and the altitude from P to CD is 3.0.
- Since triangles PAB and PCD are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**
- From the similarity of triangles PAB and PCD, we have:
  \[
  \frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{AP}{CP} = \frac{BP}{DP}
  \]
- Given AB = 2.0 and CD = 5.0, the ratio is:
  \[
  \frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{2.0}{5.0} = \frac{2}{5}
  \]
- This implies that the height from P to AB (which is 3.0) is proportional to the height from P to CD. Let \( h \) be the height from P to AB.
- By the similarity ratio, the height from P to AB will be:
  \[
  \frac{h}{3} = \frac{2}{5} \implies h = \frac{2 \times 3}{5} = \frac{6}{5}
  \]

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
- The distance between AB and CD is the difference between the distances from P to CD and P to AB.
- Therefore, the distance is:
  \[
  3.0 - \frac{6}{5} = \frac{15}{5} - \frac{6}{5} = \frac{9}{5}
  \]
- This matches choice C.
