Perpendicular(Line(days),Line(recall percentage))

QUESTION:
In a memory study, subjects are asked to memorize some content and recall as much as they can remember each day thereafter. Each day, Maximilian finds that he has forgotten $15 \%$ of what he could recount the day before. Lucy also took part in the study. The given graphs represent the percentage of content that Maximilian (gray) and Lucy (black) could remember after $t$ days. y-axis labels "days" and x-axis labels "recall percentage"

Which of the following could model the percentage that Lucy can still recall after $t$ days?

CHOICES:
A:$Q=(0.85)^{t}$
B:$Q=(0.83)^{t}$
C:$Q=(0.87)^{t}$
