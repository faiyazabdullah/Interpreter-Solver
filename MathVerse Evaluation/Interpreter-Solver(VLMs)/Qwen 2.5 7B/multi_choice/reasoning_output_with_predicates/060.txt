QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

- We have two parallel lines \(AB\) and \(CD\).
- Angle \(2\) is given as \(135^\circ\).
- We need to find the measure of angle \(1\).

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. Since \(AB \parallel CD\), angle \(2\) and angle \(1\) are corresponding angles.
2. Corresponding angles formed by a transversal intersecting two parallel lines are congruent.
3. Therefore, angle \(1 = 135^\circ\).

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

The measure of angle \(1\) is \(135^\circ\). However, this does not match any of the given choices. Given the options, the closest possible answer is \(45^\circ\) which is not a match but is the closest among the choices provided.

Final Answer: B
