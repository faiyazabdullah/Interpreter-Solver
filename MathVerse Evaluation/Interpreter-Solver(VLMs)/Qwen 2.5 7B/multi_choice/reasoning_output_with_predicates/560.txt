QUESTION:
This is a quadratic function. The y-axis labels mosquitoes (millions), and x-axis labels rainfall (centimeters). The vertex of the function is (2,4) and the function intersects with x-axis at (0,0) and (4,0). Which of these statements are true?

CHOICES:
A:The largest possible number of mosquitoes is 2 million mosquitoes.
B:The largest possible number of mosquitoes is 4 million mosquitoes.
C:More rainfall always relates to less mosquitoes.
D:More rainfall relates to less mosquitoes as long as rainfall is less than $2 \mathrm{~cm}$.

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given information and the graph step by step:

### Step 1: Understanding the Quadratic Function
The graph represents a quadratic function \( g(x) \) which models the relationship between mosquito population and rainfall. The vertex of the parabola is given as (2, 4), meaning the maximum mosquito population occurs at 2 cm of rainfall. The function intersects the x-axis at (0, 0) and (4, 0), indicating the roots of the quadratic equation.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Graph
- The vertex form of a quadratic function \( g(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k \) can be used, where \((h, k)\) is the vertex. Here, \( h = 2 \) and \( k = 4 \).
- Therefore, the function can be written as \( g(x) = a(x - 2)^2 + 4 \).

### Step 3: Determining the Coefficient \( a \)
Using one of the x-intercepts, say \( x = 0 \):
\[ g(0) = a(0 - 2)^2 + 4 = 0 \]
\[ 4a + 4 = 0 \]
\[ 4a = -4 \]
\[ a = -1 \]

So, the function is \( g(x) = -(x - 2)^2 + 4 \).

### Step 4: Evaluating Maximum Mosquito Population
The maximum mosquito population occurs at the vertex, which is (2, 4). This means the highest number of mosquitoes is 4 million.

### Step 5: Analyzing the Statements
- **Statement A**: The largest possible number of mosquitoes is 2 million mosquitoes.
  - This is incorrect because the maximum mosquito population is 4 million, not 2 million.

- **Statement B**: The largest possible number of mosquitoes is 4 million mosquitoes.
  - This is correct because the maximum mosquito population is indeed 4 million.

- **Statement C**: More rainfall always relates to less mosquitoes.
  - This is incorrect because the mosquito population is highest at 2 cm of rainfall, but decreases beyond this point.

- **Statement D**: More rainfall relates to less mosquitoes as long as rainfall is less than 2 cm.
  - This is partially correct but incomplete. It does not cover the scenario when rainfall exceeds 2 cm, where the mosquito population also decreases.

### Conclusion
The correct statement is that the largest possible number of mosquitoes is 4 million.
