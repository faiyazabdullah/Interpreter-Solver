QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

- Lines \(a\) and \(b\) are parallel.
- Line \(c\) intersects both \(a\) and \(b\).
- Angle \(1\) is given as \(50^\circ\).
- We need to find the measure of angle \(2\).

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. Since lines \(a\) and \(b\) are parallel and line \(c\) intersects both, the corresponding angles formed are congruent.
2. Angle \(1\) and angle \(2\) are corresponding angles because they are on the same side of the transversal \(c\) and between the two parallel lines \(a\) and \(b\).
3. According to the Corresponding Angles Postulate, corresponding angles are equal when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal.

Therefore, since \(\angle 1 = 50^\circ\), it follows that \(\angle 2 = 50^\circ\).

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

Final Answer: A
