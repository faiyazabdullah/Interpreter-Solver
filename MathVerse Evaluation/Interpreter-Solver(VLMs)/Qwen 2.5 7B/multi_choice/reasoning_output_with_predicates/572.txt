QUESTION:
g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function opening downward with a vertex of (-8,8). f(x)=-5(x+4)^2+8. Which function has a greater maximum?

CHOICES:
A:$f$ has a greater maximum than $g$.
B:$g$ has a greater maximum than $f$.
C:$f$ and $g$ share the same maximum.

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- The image shows the graph of \( g(x) \).
- The function \( g(x) \) is a quadratic function opening downward with its vertex at \( (-8, 8) \).
- The function \( f(x) = -5(x + 4)^2 + 8 \) is also given, which represents a parabola opening downward with its vertex at \( (-4, 8) \).
- Both functions have the same maximum value of 8.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**
- Since both \( g(x) \) and \( f(x) \) have their vertices at the same y-coordinate (8), they share the same maximum value.
- There is no indication in the image or the function definitions that one function has a greater maximum than the other.
- By the given information, the maximum values of both functions are identical.

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
- Both functions \( g(x) \) and \( f(x) \) have the same maximum value, which is 8.
- Therefore, neither function has a greater maximum than the other.
