QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the homothetic figures are composed of a triangle ruler and its center projection under the light. If the ratio of the distance from the bulb to the vertex of the triangle ruler to the distance from the bulb to the corresponding vertex of the triangular ruler projection is 2.0:5.0, and the length of one edge of the triangle ruler is 8.0, Then the corresponding edge length of the projection triangle is ()

CHOICES:
A:8cm
B:20cm
C:3.2cm
D:10cm

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- The image shows a triangle ruler and its projection under a light source.
- The given ratio of the distances from the bulb to the vertices of the triangle ruler to the corresponding vertices of its projection is \( \frac{2}{5} \).
- One side of the triangle ruler is given as 8.0 units.
- We need to find the corresponding side length of the projection triangle.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**
1. Since the triangles are similar (as stated in the predicates), the corresponding sides are proportional.
2. The ratio of the distances from the bulb to the vertices is \( \frac{2}{5} \). This means the projection triangle is scaled down compared to the original triangle.
3. Let the side length of the projection triangle be \( x \).
4. According to the similarity ratio, the side length of the projection triangle is related to the side length of the original triangle by the same ratio:
   \[
   \frac{x}{8.0} = \frac{2}{5}
   \]
5. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 8.0 \times \frac{2}{5} = 8.0 \times 0.4 = 3.2
   \]

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
- The corresponding edge length of the projection triangle is 3.2 cm.
- Therefore, the correct answer is choice C.
