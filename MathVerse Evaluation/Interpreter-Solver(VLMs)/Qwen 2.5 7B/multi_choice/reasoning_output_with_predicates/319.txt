QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- Blue quadrilateral has a diagonal of 8 yd and an area of 36 yd².
- Green quadrilateral has a diagonal of 4 yd.
- The two quadrilaterals are similar.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**
1. Since the quadrilaterals are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional.
2. Let's denote the side lengths of the blue quadrilateral as \(a\) and \(b\). The diagonal of the blue quadrilateral is given as 8 yd.
3. Using the Pythagorean theorem for the blue quadrilateral, if the diagonals of a rhombus bisect at right angles, then each half-diagonal forms a right triangle with the sides. Therefore, \(a^2 + b^2 = 8^2 = 64\).
4. The area of the blue quadrilateral is given as 36 yd². For a rhombus, the area can also be calculated using the formula \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2 \), where \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) are the diagonals. Here, let's assume the diagonals are \(8 \text{ yd}\) and another diagonal \(d\). Thus, \( \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times d = 36 \), giving \(d = 9 \text{ yd}\).
5. Now, since the diagonals of similar figures scale proportionally, the ratio of the diagonals of the green quadrilateral to the blue quadrilateral is \( \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \).
6. Therefore, the sides of the green quadrilateral are scaled down by the same factor, so the area of the green quadrilateral will be scaled down by the square of the ratio of the diagonals, which is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\).
7. Area of the green quadrilateral = \(36 \div 4 = 9 \text{ yd}^2\).

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
The area of the green quadrilateral is 9 yd².
