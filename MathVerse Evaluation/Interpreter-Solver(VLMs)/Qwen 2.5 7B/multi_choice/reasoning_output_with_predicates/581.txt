QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To determine if the given curve has an inverse function, we need to check if the function is one-to-one (i.e., if it passes the horizontal line test).

**Step 1: Analyze the curve**

From the image, the curve appears to be continuous and increasing. It passes through the points \((0, -2)\), \((3, 0)\), and \((-1, -5)\).

**Step 2: Check the horizontal line test**

The horizontal line test states that if any horizontal line intersects the graph more than once, the function is not one-to-one. Since the curve is continuous and increasing, it does not intersect any horizontal line more than once. Therefore, the curve represents a one-to-one function.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

Since the curve is one-to-one, it has an inverse function.
