QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- In triangle ABC, angle A is 80 degrees, angle B is 60 degrees.
- Point D lies on AB, point E lies on AC.
- Line DE is parallel to line BC.
- We need to find the measure of angle CED.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. Since angle BAC is 80 degrees and angle ABC is 60 degrees, we can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
   \[
   \text{Angle ACB} = 180^\circ - 80^\circ - 60^\circ = 40^\circ
   \]

2. Since DE is parallel to BC, angle ADE and angle ABC are corresponding angles, so they are equal.
   \[
   \text{Angle ADE} = 60^\circ
   \]

3. Angle AED is the same as angle ACB because they are corresponding angles due to the parallel lines.
   \[
   \text{Angle AED} = 40^\circ
   \]

4. In triangle ADE, the sum of the angles is also 180 degrees.
   \[
   \text{Angle AED} + \text{Angle ADE} + \text{Angle EAD} = 180^\circ
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   40^\circ + 60^\circ + \text{Angle EAD} = 180^\circ
   \]
   Solving for angle EAD:
   \[
   \text{Angle EAD} = 180^\circ - 100^\circ = 80^\circ
   \]

5. Since angle EAD is 80 degrees and angle EAC is 80 degrees (as E lies on AC), angle ECD is:
   \[
   \text{Angle ECD} = 40^\circ
   \]

6. Therefore, angle CED is the supplementary angle to angle ECD in triangle ADE:
   \[
   \text{Angle CED} = 180^\circ - 40^\circ = 140^\circ
   \]

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
