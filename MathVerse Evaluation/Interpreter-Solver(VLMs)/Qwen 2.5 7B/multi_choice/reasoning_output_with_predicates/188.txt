QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- Point A lies on the tangent line AB.
- Point B is the point of tangency.
- Angle B is given as 45°.
- The length of AB is 2.
- Since OA and OC are radii of the circle, they are equal.
- Triangle OAB is a right triangle because the tangent line is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.
- The measure of angle OAB is 45° because triangle OAB is a right triangle and the tangent is perpendicular to the radius.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**
1. Since triangle OAB is a right triangle with angle OAB being 45°, it is a 45-45-90 triangle.
2. In a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are congruent and the hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{2}\) times the length of a leg.
3. Therefore, OA = OB = \(\frac{AB}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}\).
4. Since OB is a radius of the circle, the radius is \(\sqrt{2}\).

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
- Now, consider triangle OBC. Since OB and OC are radii of the circle, they are equal (\(\sqrt{2}\)).
- The length BC can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OBC.
- In triangle OBC, \(OB^2 + OC^2 = BC^2\).
- Substituting the values, \((\sqrt{2})^2 + (\sqrt{2})^2 = BC^2\) which simplifies to \(2 + 2 = BC^2\), so \(BC = \sqrt{4} = 2\).
- However, we need to subtract the length of AC from BC, but since AC is half the length of AB and the radius, we have \(BC = 2 - \sqrt{2}\).
