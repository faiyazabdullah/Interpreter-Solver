QUESTION:
The graph of logarithm function $f(x)=\ln x$ (gray) and logarithm function $g(x)$ (black) is drawn below. $g(x)$ is a transformation of $f(x)$.

What sort of transformation is $g(x)$ of $f(x)$ ?

CHOICES:
A:Vertical dilation
B:Vertical translation
C:Reflection
D:Horizontal translation

Let's analyze the given graph step-by-step:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- The graph shows two functions: \( f(x) = \ln x \) (gray curve) and \( g(x) \) (black curve).
- The black curve appears to be a vertical shift of the gray curve.
- The gray curve has a y-intercept at \( y = 0 \) when \( x = 1 \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
- The gray curve \( f(x) = \ln x \) passes through the point \( (1, 0) \).
- The black curve \( g(x) \) also passes through the same point \( (1, 0) \).
- Since the curves share the same y-intercept, it indicates a possible vertical translation but not a reflection or horizontal translation.
- Observing the slope and direction of the curves, there is no change in steepness, which rules out a vertical dilation.
- The black curve is shifted upward compared to the gray curve, indicating a vertical translation.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
- Based on the above observations, the black curve \( g(x) \) is a vertical translation of the gray curve \( f(x) \).
