QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

- Point(A) is connected to points B and E.
- Points C and D form a straight line.
- Line(A,B) is parallel to Line(C,D).
- Angle C measures 70 degrees.
- Line(A,E) bisects angle CAB.
- Point E lies on Line(C,D).

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

- Since AB is parallel to CD and AE bisects angle CAB, we know that angle CAE is half of angle CAB.
- Let's denote angle CAB as \( \alpha \). Therefore, angle CAE = \( \frac{\alpha}{2} \).
- Because AB || CD, angle CAE is equal to angle AED because they are corresponding angles.
- Since angle CAE = angle AED, angle AED = \( \frac{\alpha}{2} \).

To find the measure of angle AED:
1. Calculate angle CAB using the given information about angle C.
2. Since angle C is 70 degrees, angle CAB + angle BAC = 180 degrees (as they form a linear pair with angle C).
3. Therefore, angle CAB = 180 - 70 = 110 degrees.
4. Hence, angle CAE = \( \frac{110}{2} = 55 \) degrees.
5. Therefore, angle AED = 55 degrees.

However, the problem asks for the degree of angle AED, which is the sum of angle CAE and angle AED.

Since angle CAE = 55 degrees and angle AED = 55 degrees, the total angle AED = 55 + 55 = 110 degrees.

But considering the options, it seems there might be a misinterpretation or error in the problem statement. However, based on the logical deductions, the answer should be 110 degrees.

**Final Answer: A**
