QUESTION:
Let us find the surface area of the solid given (constructed by removing a hemisphere from a cylinder). The radius is 15 cm. The height of cylinder is 22 cm.

Hence, find the total surface area of the shape.

Give our answer to two decimal places.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem of finding the total surface area of the solid formed by removing a hemisphere from a cylinder, we need to calculate the surface area of the cylinder minus the surface area of the hemisphere that was removed, plus the new curved surface area created by the cut.

### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Calculate the Surface Area of the Cylinder:**

   The formula for the total surface area of a cylinder is:
   \[
   \text{Surface Area of Cylinder} = 2\pi r h + 2\pi r^2
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

   Given:
   \[
   r = 15 \, \text{cm}, \quad h = 22 \, \text{cm}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Surface Area of Cylinder} = 2\pi (15)(22) + 2\pi (15)^2
   \]
   \[
   = 2\pi (330) + 2\pi (225)
   \]
   \[
   = 660\pi + 450\pi
   \]
   \[
   = 1110\pi \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

2. **Calculate the Surface Area of the Hemisphere:**

   The formula for the surface area of a hemisphere (excluding the base) is:
   \[
   \text{Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2\pi r^2
   \]
   Given:
   \[
   r = 15 \, \text{cm}
   \]

   Plugging in the value:
   \[
   \text{Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2\pi (15)^2
   \]
   \[
   = 2\pi (225)
   \]
   \[
   = 450\pi \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

3. **Calculate the New Curved Surface Area Created by the Cut:**

   When the hemisphere is removed from the cylinder, a new curved surface area is exposed. This new area is equal to the lateral surface area of the cylinder.

   The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is:
   \[
   \text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi r h
   \]
   Given:
   \[
   r = 15 \, \text{cm}, \quad h = 22 \, \text{cm}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi (15)(22)
   \]
   \[
   = 660\pi \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

4. **Calculate the Total Surface Area of the Solid:**

   The total surface area of the solid is the surface area of the cylinder minus the surface area of the hemisphere plus the new curved surface area created by the cut:
   \[
   \text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Surface Area of Cylinder} - \text{Surface Area of Hemisphere} + \text{Lateral Surface Area}
   \]
   \[
   = 1110\pi - 450\pi + 660\pi
   \]
   \[
   = 1320\pi \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

5. **Convert to Decimal Form:**

   Using \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
   \[
   \text{Total Surface Area} \approx 1320 \times 3.14159
   \]
   \[
   \approx 4152.38 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

Thus, the total surface area of the solid is approximately \(4152.38 \, \text{cm}^2\).

### Final Answer:

\[
\boxed{4152.38}
\]
