QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a maximum point at $\left(\frac{1}{4} \pi,-2.2\right)$ and a minimum point at $\left(\frac{3}{4} \pi,-8.5\right)$. What is the midline equation of the function?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the midline equation of the trigonometric function, let's analyze the given points and their characteristics:

1. **Identify the midline height:**
   - The maximum height of the function is the highest point, which occurs at \( y = -2.2 \).
   - The minimum height of the function is the lowest point, which occurs at \( y = -8.5 \).

2. **Calculate the average of these two heights to determine the midline height:**
   \[
   \text{Midline height} = \frac{-2.2 + (-8.5)}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Midline height} = \frac{-10.7}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Midline height} = -5.35
   \]

3. **Determine the period of the function:**
   - The distance between consecutive maximum and minimum points is the period of the function.
   - From the image, the horizontal distance between the maximum point at \( \left(\frac{1}{4} \pi, -2.2\right) \) and the next maximum point is approximately \( 2\pi \).

4. **Find the vertical shift:**
   - The midline is halfway between the maximum and minimum values.
   - Since the midline height is \(-5.35\) and the midline should be symmetric around it, we confirm that the midline is indeed the average of the maximum and minimum values.

Thus, the midline equation is given by:

\[
y = -5.35
\]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{-5.35}\]
