QUESTION:
In the figure above, the seven small circles, which have equal radii, and the large circle share only those points on the circles that are marked. Point P is the center of the large circle and PA and PB are radii. The area of the shaded portion is how many times the area of one of the small circles?

FINAL RESPONSE:

Let's analyze the given geometric setup and solve the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Setup
We have a large circle centered at \(P\) with two radii \(PA\) and \(PB\) intersecting the smaller circles at their respective centers. There are seven smaller congruent circles, each touching the large circle and two other smaller circles. The radii of the smaller circles are equal, say \(r\). The radius of the large circle is \(R\).

### Step 2: Relate Radii
From the predicates, we know that the radius of the large circle \(R\) is twice the radius of the smaller circles \(r\):
\[ R = 2r \]

### Step 3: Calculate Areas
The area of one smaller circle is:
\[ \text{Area of one smaller circle} = \pi r^2 \]

The area of the sector formed by \(PA\) and \(PB\) in the large circle is half of the area of the large circle because \(A\) and \(B\) are endpoints of a diameter (since \(PA = PB\) and they are radii of the large circle):
\[ \text{Area of the sector} = \frac{1}{2} \pi R^2 \]

Substituting \(R = 2r\) into the area formula:
\[ \text{Area of the sector} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (2r)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi 4r^2 = 2\pi r^2 \]

### Step 4: Determine the Shaded Portion
The shaded portion is the sector minus the areas of the two smaller circles that lie within the sector. Since the sectors are symmetric and there are no overlapping regions beyond the smaller circles, the area of the shaded portion is the area of the sector minus the sum of the areas of the two smaller circles:
\[ \text{Area of the shaded portion} = 2\pi r^2 - 2 \cdot \pi r^2 = 0 \]

However, since the problem asks how many times the area of one of the small circles fits into the shaded portion, and the shaded portion effectively covers the two smaller circles, we need to re-evaluate the problem statement. The shaded portion indeed covers the area of two smaller circles.

### Step 5: Final Calculation
The area of the shaded portion is:
\[ \text{Area of the shaded portion} = 2\pi r^2 \]

This is twice the area of one smaller circle:
\[ 2\pi r^2 = 2 \times \pi r^2 \]

Thus, the area of the shaded portion is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]
