QUESTION:
There is a point at 4 and a blue arrow goes to left from that point. Write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, let's break down the given information and deduce the final answer step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Image and Predicates
- The image shows a number line with a point labeled at 4.
- There is a blue arrow pointing to the left from the point at 4.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
- The blue arrow pointing to the left indicates a negative direction from the point at 4.
- Since the arrow is extending infinitely in the left direction, it implies the number line extends infinitely in the left direction starting from 4.
- Therefore, the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation starts from negative infinity and includes all real numbers less than 4.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
- The interval notation for all real numbers less than 4 is written as \((-\infty, 4)\).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{(-\infty, 4)}\]
