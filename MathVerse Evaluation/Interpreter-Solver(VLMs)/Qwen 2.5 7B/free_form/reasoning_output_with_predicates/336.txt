QUESTION:
Consider the point A. The angle between line OA and the north direction is 31°.

Find the true bearing of point A from O.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**
- We have a point \( A \) and a point \( O \).
- There is a line segment \( OA \).
- An angle \( \angle AON \) is given with a measure of 31°.
- Point \( O \) is at the origin of the coordinate system.
- The north direction is aligned with the positive y-axis.

**Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**
1. Since the angle \( \angle AON \) is 31°, and the north direction is the positive y-axis, point \( A \) lies in the second quadrant relative to the origin \( O \).
2. To find the bearing of point \( A \) from \( O \), we need to determine the angle that line \( OA \) makes with the east direction (positive x-axis). This is because the bearing is typically measured clockwise from the north direction.
3. The angle between the positive x-axis and the positive y-axis is 90°. Therefore, the angle between the positive x-axis and line \( OA \) is \( 90° - 31° = 59° \).

**Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**
- The bearing of point \( A \) from \( O \) is 59° west of north.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{59^\circ \text{ W of N}}\]
