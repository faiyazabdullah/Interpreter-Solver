QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, on the graph.

Write the equation of the circle in the form \left(x-h\right)^2+\left(y-k\right)^2=r^2.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the given predicates and the image, we know that:
1. There is a circle with center \(O\) at point \((0, 0)\) and radius \(r\).
2. Four points lie on the circle: \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

We need to determine the coordinates of these points and then find the equation of the circle.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify the coordinates of the points:**
   - Point \(A\) lies on the circle and has coordinates \((-3, y_A)\).
   - Point \(B\) lies on the circle and has coordinates \((-2, y_B)\).
   - Point \(C\) lies on the circle and has coordinates \((3, y_C)\).
   - Point \(D\) is not directly given but can be determined by symmetry since the circle is centered at the origin.

2. **Calculate the radius \(r\):**
   Since \(C\) lies on the circle, its distance from the center \((0, 0)\) is equal to the radius \(r\):
   \[
   r = \sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (y_C - 0)^2} = \sqrt{9 + y_C^2}
   \]

3. **Determine the coordinates of \(D\):**
   By symmetry, if \(A\) and \(B\) are symmetric about the y-axis, then \(D\) will be symmetric about the y-axis to \(A\) and \(B\). Thus, \(D\) will have coordinates \((3, y_D)\).

4. **Verify the radius using point \(B\):**
   Similarly, the distance from the center to \(B\) should also be \(r\):
   \[
   r = \sqrt{(-2 - 0)^2 + (y_B - 0)^2} = \sqrt{4 + y_B^2}
   \]

5. **Determine the exact values of \(y_A\), \(y_B\), and \(y_C\):**
   We know that the circle passes through \((-3, y_A)\), \((-2, y_B)\), and \((3, y_C)\). Using the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from the origin to these points equals the square of the radius squared, we can set up equations:
   \[
   (-3)^2 + y_A^2 = r^2
   \]
   \[
   (-2)^2 + y_B^2 = r^2
   \]
   \[
   3^2 + y_C^2 = r^2
   \]

6. **Solve for the radius \(r\):**
   Since \(C\) lies on the circle and we know \(r = \sqrt{9 + y_C^2}\), we substitute \(r^2 = 9 + y_C^2\) into the other equations:
   \[
   (-3)^2 + y_A^2 = 9 + y_C^2
   \]
   \[
   (-2)^2 + y_B^2 = 9 + y_C^2
   \]

Given the symmetry and the fact that the circle is centered at the origin, the coordinates of \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) must satisfy the circle's equation. By solving these equations, we find:
   \[
   y_A^2 = y_B^2 = 9 - y_C^2
   \]
   Since \(C\) lies on the circle and \(y_C^2 = 9 - r^2\), we get:
   \[
   r^2 = 9
   \]

Thus, the radius \(r\) is \(3\).

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The equation of the circle is:
\[
(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = 3^2
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 9
\]

Final Answer: \(\boxed{x^2 + y^2 = 9}\)
