QUESTION:
The graph shows the temperature of a room after the heater has been turned on. What is the slope of the shown function that passes the point (0, 1)?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step-by-step.

**Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**

From the image, we have a linear function representing the temperature over time. The function passes through the point (0, 1) and has a positive slope. We need to determine the slope of this function.

**Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

1. Identify the given points on the graph: The graph shows a straight line passing through the point (0, 1). This means when time (t) is 0 minutes, the temperature (T) is 1 degree Celsius.
   
2. Identify two other points on the line: The graph also shows that at t = 20 minutes, T = 5 degrees Celsius.

3. Use the formula for the slope (m) of a line passing through two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\):
   \[
   m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
   \]
   Here, \((x_1, y_1) = (0, 1)\) and \((x_2, y_2) = (20, 5)\).

4. Substitute these values into the slope formula:
   \[
   m = \frac{5 - 1}{20 - 0} = \frac{4}{20} = \frac{1}{5}
   \]

So, the slope of the line is \(\frac{1}{5}\).

**Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**

The slope of the shown function is \(\frac{1}{5}\).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{\frac{1}{5}}\]
