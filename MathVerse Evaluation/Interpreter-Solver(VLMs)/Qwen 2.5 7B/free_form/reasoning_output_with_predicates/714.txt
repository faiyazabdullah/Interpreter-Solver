QUESTION:
Find the surface area of the prism shown. The bottom is a rectangular prism with edges of 6m, 5m and 10m. The top is a triangular prism. The marked edges are the same length.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

To solve for the surface area of the given prism, we need to calculate the surface area of the rectangular base and the lateral faces of the prism. 

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the dimensions and shapes involved:**
   - The bottom is a rectangle with sides \(6 \, \text{m}\) and \(5 \, \text{m}\).
   - The top is a triangular prism with a height of \(3 \, \text{m}\). The base of the triangular prism is also a rectangle with sides \(6 \, \text{m}\) and \(5 \, \text{m}\), making it congruent to the bottom rectangle.
   - The edges marked as equal are \(3 \, \text{m}\).

2. **Calculate the surface area of the rectangular base:**
   - The bottom and top rectangles have an area of \(6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{m}^2\) each.
   - Therefore, the total area for the two bases is \(2 \times 30 = 60 \, \text{m}^2\).

3. **Calculate the lateral surface area:**
   - The prism has four lateral faces: two rectangles and two trapezoids.
   - The two vertical rectangles have heights of \(3 \, \text{m}\) and widths of \(5 \, \text{m}\) and \(6 \, \text{m}\) respectively.
     - Area of the first rectangle: \(5 \times 3 = 15 \, \text{m}^2\)
     - Area of the second rectangle: \(6 \times 3 = 18 \, \text{m}^2\)
   - The two trapezoids have parallel sides of lengths \(5 \, \text{m}\) and \(6 \, \text{m}\), and a height of \(3 \, \text{m}\).
     - Area of one trapezoid: \(\frac{1}{2} \times (5 + 6) \times 3 = \frac{1}{2} \times 11 \times 3 = 16.5 \, \text{m}^2\)
     - Total area for the two trapezoids: \(2 \times 16.5 = 33 \, \text{m}^2\)

4. **Sum the areas:**
   - Total surface area = Area of the two bases + Area of the four lateral faces
   - Total surface area = \(60 \, \text{m}^2 + 15 \, \text{m}^2 + 18 \, \text{m}^2 + 16.5 \, \text{m}^2 = 109.5 \, \text{m}^2\)

### Final Answer:

\[
\boxed{109.5}
\]
