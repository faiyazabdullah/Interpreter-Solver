QUESTION:
The x-intercept of the line is -1.5 and the y-intercept is 3. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane, let's follow the given predicates and analyze the image step-by-step.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- The line passes through the points \((0, 3)\) and \((-1.5, 0)\).
- The x-intercept is \(-1.5\) and the y-intercept is \(3\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Equation of the Line:**
   - The slope \(m\) of the line passing through the points \((0, 3)\) and \((-1.5, 0)\) is calculated as:
     \[
     m = \frac{0 - 3}{-1.5 - 0} = \frac{-3}{-1.5} = 2
     \]
   - Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\) with point \((0, 3)\):
     \[
     y - 3 = 2(x - 0) \implies y = 2x + 3
     \]

2. **Inequality for the Shaded Region:**
   - The shaded region is on the side of the line \(y = 2x + 3\) that does not include the points \((0, 3)\) and \((-1.5, 0)\). Since these points lie above the line, the shaded region is below the line.
   - Therefore, the inequality representing the shaded region is:
     \[
     y < 2x + 3
     \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
- The inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane is:
\[
\boxed{y < 2x + 3}
\]
