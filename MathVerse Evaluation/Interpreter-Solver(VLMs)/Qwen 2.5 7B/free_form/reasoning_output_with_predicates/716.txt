FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the surface area of the solid formed by combining a rectangular prism and a cylinder. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Surface Area of the Rectangular Prism
The dimensions of the rectangular prism are 20, 25, and 33. The formula for the surface area of a rectangular prism is given by:
\[ \text{Surface Area}_{\text{prism}} = 2(lw + lh + wh) \]
where \( l \), \( w \), and \( h \) are the length, width, and height respectively.

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Surface Area}_{\text{prism}} = 2(20 \times 25 + 20 \times 33 + 25 \times 33) \]
\[ \text{Surface Area}_{\text{prism}} = 2(500 + 660 + 825) \]
\[ \text{Surface Area}_{\text{prism}} = 2 \times 2085 \]
\[ \text{Surface Area}_{\text{prism}} = 4170 \]

### Step 2: Surface Area of the Cylinder
The formula for the surface area of a cylinder (excluding the top and bottom) is:
\[ \text{Surface Area}_{\text{cylinder}} = 2\pi rh \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.

Given the radius \( r = 6 \) and height \( h = 11 \):
\[ \text{Surface Area}_{\text{cylinder}} = 2\pi \times 6 \times 11 \]
\[ \text{Surface Area}_{\text{cylinder}} = 132\pi \]

### Step 3: Surface Area of the Combined Solid
The combined solid has the same dimensions as the rectangular prism but with a circular hole where the cylinder is placed. The surface area of the combined solid will be the surface area of the rectangular prism minus the lateral surface area of the cylinder plus the area of the two bases of the cylinder (since they are not exposed).

The lateral surface area of the cylinder is:
\[ \text{Lateral Surface Area}_{\text{cylinder}} = 2\pi rh \]
\[ \text{Lateral Surface Area}_{\text{cylinder}} = 132\pi \]

The area of the two bases of the cylinder is:
\[ \text{Area of Two Bases}_{\text{cylinder}} = 2\pi r^2 \]
\[ \text{Area of Two Bases}_{\text{cylinder}} = 2\pi \times 6^2 \]
\[ \text{Area of Two Bases}_{\text{cylinder}} = 72\pi \]

Thus, the total surface area of the combined solid is:
\[ \text{Surface Area}_{\text{combined}} = \text{Surface Area}_{\text{prism}} + \text{Area of Two Bases}_{\text{cylinder}} - \text{Lateral Surface Area}_{\text{cylinder}} \]
\[ \text{Surface Area}_{\text{combined}} = 4170 + 72\pi - 132\pi \]
\[ \text{Surface Area}_{\text{combined}} = 4170 - 60\pi \]

Using the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14\):
\[ \text{Surface Area}_{\text{combined}} = 4170 - 60 \times 3.14 \]
\[ \text{Surface Area}_{\text{combined}} = 4170 - 188.4 \]
\[ \text{Surface Area}_{\text{combined}} = 4081.6 \]

Rounding to two decimal places:
\[ \boxed{4081.60} \]
