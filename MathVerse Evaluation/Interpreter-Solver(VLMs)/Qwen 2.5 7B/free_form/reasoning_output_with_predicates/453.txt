QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, in the graph.

State the coordinates of the centre in the form $(a, b)$.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step-by-step.

**Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**

From the image, we can observe that the circle intersects the axes at four points. These points are likely the intercepts of the circle with the x-axis and y-axis. By analyzing the positions, we can infer the center of the circle.

**Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

1. **Identify Intersection Points:**
   From the image, the circle intersects the x-axis at points \(A\) and \(D\), and the y-axis at points \(B\) and \(C\).

2. **Symmetry of Circle:**
   Since the circle intersects the axes symmetrically, the center of the circle must lie on the origin of the coordinate system because the circle is symmetric about both the x-axis and y-axis.

3. **Calculate Coordinates of Center:**
   Given the symmetry and the fact that the circle passes through the origin, the center of the circle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

**Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**

The coordinates of the center of the circle are \((0, 0)\).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{(0, 0)}\]
