QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $\left(\frac{2}{3} \pi, 1.2\right)$, and it has a minimum point at $\left(\frac{4}{3} \pi,-3.4\right)$. What is the amplitude of the function?

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the given information and geometric reasoning.

**Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**

We are given two points on the graph:
- Point \( A \) lies on the line \( l \) and has coordinates \( \left( \frac{2}{3} \pi, 1.2 \right) \).
- Point \( B \) lies on the line \( l \) and has coordinates \( \left( \frac{4}{3} \pi, -3.4 \right) \).

The line \( l \) intersects the midline of the trigonometric function at \( \left( \frac{2}{3} \pi, 1.2 \right) \). The midline is the horizontal line that passes through the middle of the sine wave, which is the average of the maximum and minimum values of the function. In this case, the maximum value is 6 and the minimum value is -4, so the midline is at \( y = 1 \).

The length of the line segment \( AB \) is given as 1.2. We need to determine the amplitude of the function.

**Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

1. Since the line \( l \) intersects the midline at \( \left( \frac{2}{3} \pi, 1.2 \right) \), the distance from the midline to either \( A \) or \( B \) will give us half the amplitude of the function. The distance from the midline \( y = 1 \) to \( y = 1.2 \) is \( 1.2 - 1 = 0.2 \).
2. The distance from the midline to the minimum value (or maximum value) of the function is the full amplitude. Since the distance from the midline to \( y = -3.4 \) is \( | -3.4 - 1 | = 4.4 \), the full amplitude is 4.4.

Therefore, the amplitude of the function is \( \boxed{4.4} \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{4.4}\]
