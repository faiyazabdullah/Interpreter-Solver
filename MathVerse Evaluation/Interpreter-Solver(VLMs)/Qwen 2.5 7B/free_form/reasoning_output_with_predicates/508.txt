QUESTION:
Consider the graph of the line whose x-intercept is 0.5 and y-intercept is 2. What is the slope of the line?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

- The image shows a line passing through the points \(A(0.5, 0)\) and \(B(0, 2)\).
- The coordinates of point \(A\) are given as \(A(0.5, 0)\).
- The coordinates of point \(B\) are given as \(B(0, 2)\).

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. Since point \(A\) lies on the x-axis (\(y = 0\)) and has an x-coordinate of 0.5, it means the x-intercept of the line is 0.5.
2. Similarly, since point \(B\) lies on the y-axis (\(x = 0\)) and has a y-coordinate of 2, it means the y-intercept of the line is 2.
3. To find the slope of the line, we use the formula for the slope between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\):
   \[
   \text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
   \]
   Substituting the coordinates of points \(A\) and \(B\):
   \[
   \text{slope} = \frac{2 - 0}{0 - 0.5} = \frac{2}{-0.5} = -4
   \]

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

The slope of the line is \(-4\).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{-4}\]
