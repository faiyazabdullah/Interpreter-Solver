QUESTION:
Consider the points on the diagram P, A and N where N denotes the north cardinal point. Angle PAN is 45°.

Using the diagram, find the true bearing of P from A.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

- Points: P, A, and N are given.
- Line segments: PA and AN are drawn.
- Angle PAN is measured as 45°.
- N denotes the north cardinal direction.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. **Identify the bearing of P from A**: The bearing of point P from point A is the direction from A to P relative to the north direction.
2. **Analyze the angle**: Since angle PAN is 45°, it indicates that the direction from A to P forms a 45° angle with the north direction.
3. **Determine the bearing**: In terms of standard bearing notation (measured clockwise from north), a 45° angle east of north corresponds to a bearing of 45°.

**Conclusion**:
The bearing of P from A is 45°.

**Final Answer: \[\boxed{45^\circ}\]**
