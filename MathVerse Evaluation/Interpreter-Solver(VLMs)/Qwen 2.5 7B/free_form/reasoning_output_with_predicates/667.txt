QUESTION:
In this question we will find the surface area of the following solid hemispher with a radius of 6:

What is the area of the circular base of the hemisphere?

Round your answer to three decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- The image shows a hemisphere with a given radius of 6.
- The predicate `RadiusOf(Hemisphere)` states that the radius of the hemisphere is 6.
- The base of the hemisphere is a circle, which is also stated by the predicate `Circle(BaseOf(Hemisphere))`.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**
- Since the base of the hemisphere is a circle, we need to find the area of this circle.
- The area of a circle is given by the formula \( \text{Area} = \pi r^2 \), where \( r \) is the radius.
- From the predicate, the radius \( r \) of the circle is 6.
- Substituting the radius into the formula, we get:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \pi \times 6^2 = \pi \times 36 = 36\pi
  \]

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
- The area of the circular base of the hemisphere is \( 36\pi \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{36\pi}\]
