QUESTION:
Calculate the volume of the half cylinder with a diameter of 6 cm and a height of 12 cm. Correct to one decimal place.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- The given shape is a half-cylinder.
- The radius \( r \) of the half-cylinder is 6 cm.
- The height \( h \) of the half-cylinder is 12 cm.
- The volume \( V \) of a full cylinder is given by the formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \).
- Since we have a half-cylinder, the volume will be half of the volume of a full cylinder with the same radius and height.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**
- First, calculate the volume of a full cylinder with radius 6 cm and height 12 cm.
- The volume of the full cylinder is \( V_{\text{full}} = \pi r^2 h = \pi \times 6^2 \times 12 \).
- Simplify the expression: \( V_{\text{full}} = \pi \times 36 \times 12 = 432\pi \).
- Since the shape is a half-cylinder, the volume of the half-cylinder is half of the volume of the full cylinder.
- Therefore, the volume of the half-cylinder is \( V_{\text{half}} = \frac{432\pi}{2} = 216\pi \).

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
- The volume of the half-cylinder is \( 216\pi \) cubic centimeters.
- To express this value correct to one decimal place, we use the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \).
- Calculate \( 216 \pi \): \( 216 \times 3.14159 \approx 678.58 \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{678.6}\]
