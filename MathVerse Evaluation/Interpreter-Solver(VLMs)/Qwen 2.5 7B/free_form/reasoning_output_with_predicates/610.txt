QUESTION:
The graph shows the number of earthquakes in a particular country. The x-axis represents years, and the y-axis represents the number of earthquakes.

What is the average rate of change?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine the average rate of change.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- The x-axis represents years.
- The y-axis represents the number of earthquakes.
- There are four points plotted: (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), and (4, 6).
- These points form a horizontal line at \( y = 6 \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify the Points**: The points (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), and (4, 6) lie on a horizontal line at \( y = 6 \).
2. **Determine the Rate of Change**: The rate of change is calculated as the difference in y-values divided by the difference in x-values.
   - The y-values are constant at 6 for all x-values.
   - Therefore, the change in y is \( 6 - 6 = 0 \).
   - The change in x is \( 4 - 1 = 3 \).
   - The rate of change is \( \frac{0}{3} = 0 \).

### Conclusion and Selection
The average rate of change is 0.

Final Answer: \(\boxed{0}\)
