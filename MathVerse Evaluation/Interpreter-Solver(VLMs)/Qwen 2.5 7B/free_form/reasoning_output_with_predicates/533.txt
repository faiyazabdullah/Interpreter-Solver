QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $(-3.5,-0.8)$, and it has a maximum point at $(4.1,0.7)$. What is the amplitude of the function?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the amplitude of the trigonometric function, let's analyze the given information and the graph:

1. **Identify the midline and points of interest:**
   - The midline is the horizontal line that passes through the midpoint of the function's oscillations.
   - The function intersects its midline at \( (-3.5, -0.8) \).
   - The maximum point of the function is at \( (4.1, 0.7) \).

2. **Determine the midline:**
   - Since the function intersects the midline at \( (-3.5, -0.8) \), the y-coordinate of the midline is \( -0.8 \).
   - Therefore, the midline equation is \( y = -0.8 \).

3. **Calculate the amplitude:**
   - The amplitude is half the distance between the maximum and minimum values of the function.
   - From the graph, the maximum value is \( 0.7 \) and the minimum value appears to be \( -2 \).

4. **Compute the distance between the maximum and minimum values:**
   - Distance between maximum and minimum = \( 0.7 - (-2) = 0.7 + 2 = 2.7 \).

5. **Divide by 2 to find the amplitude:**
   - Amplitude = \( \frac{2.7}{2} = 1.35 \).

Thus, the amplitude of the function is \( 1.35 \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{1.35}\]
