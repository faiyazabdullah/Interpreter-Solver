QUESTION:
There is a linear function with a y-intercept of 3 and a x-intercept of 2. Determine the function expression of f shown in the figure.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
We have the following information from the predicates and the image:
- Point \(A\) has coordinates \((0, 3)\).
- Point \(B\) has coordinates \((2, 0)\).
- The line \(AB\) passes through these points.
- We need to find the equation of the line \(f\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify the slope of the line \(AB\)**:
   The slope \(m\) of a line passing through two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
   \[
   m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
   \]
   Substituting the coordinates of points \(A\) and \(B\):
   \[
   m = \frac{0 - 3}{2 - 0} = \frac{-3}{2} = -1.5
   \]

2. **Write the equation of the line in slope-intercept form**:
   The slope-intercept form of a line is \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the y-intercept.
   Here, the slope \(m = -1.5\) and the y-intercept \(b = 3\). Therefore, the equation of the line \(f\) is:
   \[
   y = -1.5x + 3
   \]

### Conclusion and Selection
The equation of the line \(f\) is:
\[
\boxed{y = -1.5x + 3}
\]

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $y = -1.5x + 3$
