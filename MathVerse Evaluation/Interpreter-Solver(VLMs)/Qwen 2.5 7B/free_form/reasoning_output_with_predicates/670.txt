QUESTION:
A solid consists of a cylinder (of radius 5mm and height 11mm) attached to a rectangular prism on one of its faces. The rectangular prism has sides of length 21mm, 10mm and 65mm. We wish to find the surface area of the entire solid. Note that an area is called 'exposed' if it is not covered by the other object.
What is the exposed surface area of the rectangular prism? Give your answer correct to two decimal places.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Components:**
   - The figure consists of a rectangular prism and a cylinder attached to one of its faces.
   - The dimensions of the rectangular prism are 21mm (width), 10mm (height), and 65mm (depth).
   - The cylinder has a radius of 5mm and a height of 11mm.

2. **Calculate the Surface Area of the Rectangular Prism:**
   - The surface area of a rectangular prism is given by the formula \(2lw + 2lh + 2wh\), where \(l\) is the length, \(w\) is the width, and \(h\) is the height.
   - Here, the dimensions are \(l = 65mm\), \(w = 21mm\), and \(h = 10mm\).

   \[
   \text{Surface Area} = 2 \times (65 \times 21) + 2 \times (65 \times 10) + 2 \times (21 \times 10)
   \]

   Calculate each term:
   \[
   2 \times (65 \times 21) = 2 \times 1365 = 2730 \, \text{mm}^2
   \]
   \[
   2 \times (65 \times 10) = 2 \times 650 = 1300 \, \text{mm}^2
   \]
   \[
   2 \times (21 \times 10) = 2 \times 210 = 420 \, \text{mm}^2
   \]

   Sum these values:
   \[
   2730 + 1300 + 420 = 4450 \, \text{mm}^2
   \]

3. **Calculate the Surface Area of the Cylinder:**
   - The lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula \(2\pi rh\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height.
   - Here, \(r = 5mm\) and \(h = 11mm\).

   \[
   \text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2 \times \pi \times 5 \times 11 = 110\pi \, \text{mm}^2
   \]

4. **Determine the Exposed Surface Area of the Rectangular Prism:**
   - The cylinder covers some of the surface area of the rectangular prism.
   - The cylinder's base and top are completely covered by the rectangular prism, so they don't contribute to the exposed surface area.
   - The cylinder's lateral surface is partially exposed but not fully.

5. **Exposed Surface Area Calculation:**
   - The exposed surface area includes the two side faces of the rectangular prism and the bottom face of the cylinder.
   - The two side faces have an area of \(2 \times 65 \times 10 = 1300 \, \text{mm}^2\).
   - The bottom face of the cylinder has an area of \(5 \times 11 = 55 \, \text{mm}^2\).

   \[
   \text{Exposed Surface Area} = 1300 + 55 = 1355 \, \text{mm}^2
   \]

### Final Answer:

Final Answer: \[\boxed{1355}\]
