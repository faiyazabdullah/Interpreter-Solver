QUESTION:
Consider the two similar spheres shown. The smaller sphere has radius $3$ cm while the larger sphere has a radius of 12 cm.


Find the volume of Sphere A, in simplest exact form.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- The image shows two spheres, A and B.
- The smaller sphere A has a radius of 3 cm.
- The larger sphere B has a radius of 12 cm.
- Both spheres are similar, meaning their corresponding dimensions are proportional.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**
1. Since the spheres are similar, the ratio of their radii is equal to the ratio of their volumes.
2. The ratio of the radii \( r_A \) to \( r_B \) is \( \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \).
3. Therefore, the ratio of their volumes \( V_A \) to \( V_B \) is \( \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^3 = \frac{1}{64} \).
4. The volume of sphere A \( V_A \) can be expressed as \( \frac{1}{64} V_B \).

Next, we need to find the volume of sphere B. The formula for the volume of a sphere is \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \).

- Volume of sphere B \( V_B = \frac{4}{3} \pi (12)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 1728 = 2304 \pi \).

Now, we calculate the volume of sphere A:

\[ V_A = \frac{1}{64} V_B = \frac{1}{64} \cdot 2304 \pi = 36 \pi \].

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
The volume of sphere A is \( 36 \pi \) cubic centimeters.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{36\pi}\]
