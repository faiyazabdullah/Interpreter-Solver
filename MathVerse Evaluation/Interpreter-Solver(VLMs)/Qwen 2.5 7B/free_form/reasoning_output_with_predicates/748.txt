QUESTION:
The following is a right pyramid on a square base with side length 16cm. A right pyramid has its apex aligned directly above the centre of its base.

The edge length VA is 26cm.
Find the length of VW, the perpendicular height of the pyramid correct to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's start by analyzing the given geometric figure and the predicates provided.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

- We have a right pyramid with a square base \(ABCD\) and apex \(V\).
- The side length of the square base \(ABCD\) is 16 cm.
- The edge length \(VA\) is 26 cm.
- The point \(W\) lies on the midpoints of the sides of the square \(ABCD\) and is also the foot of the perpendicular from \(V\) to the plane containing the square \(ABCD\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

1. **Identify the height of the square base:**
   - Since \(ABCD\) is a square with side length 16 cm, the diagonal \(AC\) (which is also the diameter of the circumscribed circle of the square) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     AC = \sqrt{16^2 + 16^2} = \sqrt{256 + 256} = \sqrt{512} = 16\sqrt{2} \text{ cm}
     \]

2. **Determine the center of the square base:**
   - Let \(O\) be the center of the square \(ABCD\). The distance from \(O\) to any vertex (e.g., \(A\)) is half the diagonal:
     \[
     OA = \frac{AC}{2} = \frac{16\sqrt{2}}{2} = 8\sqrt{2} \text{ cm}
     \]

3. **Position of the apex \(V\):**
   - Since \(V\) is directly above the center \(O\) of the square, \(VO\) is the height of the pyramid.
   - The length \(VA\) is given as 26 cm. Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle VOA\):
     \[
     VA^2 = VO^2 + OA^2 \implies 26^2 = VO^2 + (8\sqrt{2})^2 \implies 676 = VO^2 + 128 \implies VO^2 = 548 \implies VO = \sqrt{548} = 2\sqrt{137} \text{ cm}
     \]

4. **Height \(VW\):**
   - Since \(W\) is the midpoint of each side of the square, it lies at a distance of \(8\) cm from each vertex (half the side length).
   - \(W\) is also the foot of the perpendicular from \(V\) to the plane of the square, meaning \(VW\) is the height of the pyramid from \(V\) to the plane containing the square \(ABCD\).

5. **Calculate \(VW\):**
   - In \(\triangle VOA\), we already know \(VO = 2\sqrt{137}\) and \(OA = 8\sqrt{2}\).
   - The height \(VW\) is simply the perpendicular distance from \(V\) to the plane of the square, which is the same as the altitude of the right triangle formed by \(VO\), \(OA\), and \(VW\).

Thus, the length of \(VW\) is the same as the altitude of the right triangle formed by the height of the pyramid and the distance from the center of the square to a side, which is the radius of the circumscribed circle of the square divided by 2.

Finally, the length of \(VW\) is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]
