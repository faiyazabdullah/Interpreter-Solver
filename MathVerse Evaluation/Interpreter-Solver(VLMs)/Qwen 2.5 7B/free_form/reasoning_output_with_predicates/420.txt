QUESTION:
The perimeter is equal to the sum of the four side lengths of the trapezium. Find the length of the missing side of the trapezium shown.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the missing side of the trapezium. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- Trapezium \(ABCD\) with bases \(AB = 10 \, \text{cm}\) and \(CD\) as the missing side.
- A perpendicular segment \(EF\) is drawn from point \(E\) on \(AD\) to \(BC\) with \(EF = 6 \, \text{cm}\).

### Step 2: Use the properties of the trapezium
In a trapezium, the height (perpendicular distance between the two parallel sides) is the same at all points between the parallel sides. Since \(EF\) is perpendicular to \(BC\) and lies on \(AD\), it forms a right triangle with the corresponding sides of the trapezium.

### Step 3: Deduce the length of the missing side
Since \(EF\) is perpendicular to \(BC\) and forms a right triangle with the bases \(AB\) and \(CD\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(CD\).

Let's denote the length of \(CD\) as \(x\). The height \(EF = 6 \, \text{cm}\) is common to the right triangles formed by the heights from \(A\) and \(D\) to \(BC\).

### Step 4: Set up the equation using the Pythagorean theorem
Consider the right triangle formed by \(AB\), the height \(EF\), and the segment \(AE\):
\[ AB^2 = AE^2 + EF^2 \]
\[ 10^2 = AE^2 + 6^2 \]
\[ 100 = AE^2 + 36 \]
\[ AE^2 = 64 \]
\[ AE = 8 \]

Similarly, consider the right triangle formed by \(CD\), the height \(EF\), and the segment \(DF\):
\[ CD^2 = DF^2 + EF^2 \]
\[ x^2 = DF^2 + 6^2 \]
\[ x^2 = DF^2 + 36 \]

Since \(AE\) and \(DF\) are segments of the same height and the trapezium is symmetric, we can assume \(AE = DF = 8\). Therefore:
\[ x^2 = 8^2 + 36 \]
\[ x^2 = 64 + 36 \]
\[ x^2 = 100 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Thus, the length of the missing side \(CD\) is \(10 \, \text{cm}\).

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
