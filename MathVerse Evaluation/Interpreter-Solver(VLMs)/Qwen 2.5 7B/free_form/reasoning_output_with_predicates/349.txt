QUESTION:
Considering the diagram below, ABCD is a rectangle, find x, the angle of depression from point B to point C. The lengths of AC and BC are 3 and 5, respectively.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step-by-step using systematic deduction.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- We have a rectangle \(ABCD\) with \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) being points.
- The length of \(AC\) is 3.
- The length of \(BC\) is 5.
- Angle \(ABC\) is a right angle because it lies in a rectangle.
- We need to find the measure of angle \(x\), which is the angle of depression from point \(B\) to point \(C\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, all its internal angles are right angles.
2. In the right triangle \(ABC\), \(AC\) is the hypotenuse.
3. We know that \(AB\) and \(BC\) are perpendicular to each other.
4. Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABC \):
   \[
   AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   AB^2 + 5^2 = 3^2
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   AB^2 + 25 = 9
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   AB^2 = 9 - 25 = -16
   \]
   This calculation is incorrect because \(AB\) should be the height corresponding to the base \(BC\) in a right triangle, so let's correct our approach.

5. Instead, we can use trigonometry to find the angle \(x\). The angle \(x\) is the angle at \(B\) in the right triangle \(ABC\).
6. The tangent of angle \(x\) is given by:
   \[
   \tan(x) = \frac{opposite}{adjacent} = \frac{BC}{AB}
   \]
   Here, \(BC\) is the adjacent side and \(AB\) is the opposite side to angle \(x\).

7. From the triangle properties and the given lengths:
   \[
   \tan(x) = \frac{5}{AB}
   \]
   We know \(AB\) must be positive and smaller than 5 since \(AB\) is the height in the right triangle.

8. Solving for \(AB\):
   \[
   AB = \sqrt{3^2 - 5^2} = \sqrt{9 - 16} = \sqrt{-7}
   \]
   This is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the triangle properties correctly.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
Given the right triangle properties and the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
\sin(x) = \frac{BC}{AC} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{3^2 + 5^2}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{34}}
\]
Thus:
\[
x = \arcsin\left(\frac{5}{\sqrt{34}}\right)
\]

### Final Answer:
Using a calculator to find the numerical value:
\[
x \approx 65.31^\circ
\]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{65.31}\]
