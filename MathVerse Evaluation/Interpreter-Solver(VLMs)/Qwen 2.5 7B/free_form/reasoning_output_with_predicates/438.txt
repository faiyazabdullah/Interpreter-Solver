QUESTION:
There is a hyperbola in blue with two vertices highlighted at (2,-3) and (-8,-3). It's center is at (-3,-3) highlighted by orange and its Foci is also hightlighted in lightgreen at ($-3-5\sqrt{2}$,-3) and ($-3+5\sqrt{2}$,-3). Find the equation of the hyperbola.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- The hyperbola is centered at point \(C = (-3, -3)\).
- The vertices of the hyperbola are at points \(A = (-8, -3)\) and \(B = (2, -3)\).
- The foci of the hyperbola are at points \(F_1 = (-3 - 5\sqrt{2}, -3)\) and \(F_2 = (-3 + 5\sqrt{2}, -3)\).

#### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Determine the distance between the vertices:**
   - The distance between the vertices \(A\) and \(B\) is:
     \[
     AB = |2 - (-8)| = |2 + 8| = 10
     \]
   - This distance is equal to \(2a\), where \(a\) is the distance from the center to each vertex. Thus,
     \[
     2a = 10 \implies a = 5
     \]

2. **Determine the distance between the foci:**
   - The distance between the foci \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) is:
     \[
     F_1F_2 = |-3 + 5\sqrt{2} - (-3 - 5\sqrt{2})| = |5\sqrt{2} + 5\sqrt{2}| = 10\sqrt{2}
     \]
   - This distance is equal to \(2c\), where \(c\) is the distance from the center to each focus. Thus,
     \[
     2c = 10\sqrt{2} \implies c = 5\sqrt{2}
     \]

3. **Determine the value of \(b\) using the relationship \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\):**
   - We have \(a = 5\) and \(c = 5\sqrt{2}\).
   - Substitute these values into the relationship:
     \[
     (5\sqrt{2})^2 = 5^2 + b^2 \implies 50 = 25 + b^2 \implies b^2 = 25 \implies b = 5
     \]

4. **Write the standard form of the equation of the hyperbola:**
   - Since the transverse axis is vertical, the standard form of the hyperbola is:
     \[
     \frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1
     \]
   - Here, the center \((h, k) = (-3, -3)\), \(a = 5\), and \(b = 5\).
   - Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
     \[
     \frac{(y + 3)^2}{25} - \frac{(x + 3)^2}{25} = 1
     \]

#### Conclusion:
The equation of the hyperbola is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{(y + 3)^2}{25} - \frac{(x + 3)^2}{25} = 1}
\]

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $\frac{(y + 3)^2}{25} - \frac{(x + 3)^2}{25} = 1$
