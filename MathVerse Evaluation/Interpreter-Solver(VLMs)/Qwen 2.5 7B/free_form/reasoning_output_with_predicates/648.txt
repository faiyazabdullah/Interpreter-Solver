QUESTION:
Find the volume of the sphere shown. The radius is 3 centimeters.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- The image shows a circle with a radius of 3 cm.
- The radius is labeled as 3 cm, which means the radius of the circle is 3 cm.
- The question asks for the volume of the sphere, which is formed by rotating the circle around its diameter.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**
- Since the circle has a radius of 3 cm, the diameter of the circle is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) cm.
- When this circle is rotated around its diameter, it forms a sphere with a radius of 3 cm.
- The formula for the volume of a sphere is given by:
  \[
  V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
  \]
- Here, the radius \(r\) of the sphere is 3 cm.
- Substitute \(r = 3\) into the formula:
  \[
  V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 27 = 36 \pi
  \]

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
- The volume of the sphere is \(36 \pi\) cubic centimeters.
- To express this in a more practical form, we can approximate \(\pi\) as 3.14:
  \[
  V \approx 36 \times 3.14 = 113.04 \text{ cm}^3
  \]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{113.04}\]
