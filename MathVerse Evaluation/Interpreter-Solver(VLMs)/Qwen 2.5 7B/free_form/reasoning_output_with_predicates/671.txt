QUESTION:
We want to find the surface area of this shape. Assume that both boxes are identical in size. The box has sides of length 25, 20 and 33. The cylinder has a radius of 6 and a height of 11.

Find the surface area of the solid.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the surface area of the solid, we need to calculate the surface area of both the rectangular prism and the cylinder separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the Surface Area of the Rectangular Prism
The rectangular prism has dimensions 25, 20, and 33.

#### Surface Area of One Face
A rectangular prism has six faces. The two largest faces have dimensions 33 × 25, and the other four faces have dimensions 20 × 25 and 20 × 33.

The area of one large face (33 × 25):
\[ A_{\text{large}} = 33 \times 25 = 825 \]

The area of one small face (20 × 25):
\[ A_{\text{small1}} = 20 \times 25 = 500 \]

The area of one small face (20 × 33):
\[ A_{\text{small2}} = 20 \times 33 = 660 \]

#### Total Surface Area of the Prism
The total surface area \( S_{\text{prism}} \) is twice the sum of the areas of the large and small faces:
\[ S_{\text{prism}} = 2 \times (2 \times 825 + 2 \times 500 + 2 \times 660) \]
\[ S_{\text{prism}} = 2 \times (1650 + 1000 + 1320) \]
\[ S_{\text{prism}} = 2 \times 4070 = 8140 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Surface Area of the Cylinder
The cylinder has a radius of 6 and a height of 11.

#### Lateral Surface Area of the Cylinder
The lateral surface area \( A_{\text{lateral}} \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[ A_{\text{lateral}} = 2 \pi r h \]
where \( r = 6 \) and \( h = 11 \):
\[ A_{\text{lateral}} = 2 \pi \times 6 \times 11 = 132 \pi \]

#### Area of the Two Bases of the Cylinder
The area of one base is:
\[ A_{\text{base}} = \pi r^2 \]
\[ A_{\text{base}} = \pi \times 6^2 = 36 \pi \]

Since there are two bases, the total area of the bases is:
\[ A_{\text{bases}} = 2 \times 36 \pi = 72 \pi \]

#### Total Surface Area of the Cylinder
The total surface area \( S_{\text{cylinder}} \) is the sum of the lateral surface area and the area of the two bases:
\[ S_{\text{cylinder}} = A_{\text{lateral}} + A_{\text{bases}} \]
\[ S_{\text{cylinder}} = 132 \pi + 72 \pi = 204 \pi \]

### Step 3: Total Surface Area of the Solid
The total surface area \( S_{\text{total}} \) of the solid is the sum of the surface area of the prism and the cylinder:
\[ S_{\text{total}} = S_{\text{prism}} + S_{\text{cylinder}} \]
\[ S_{\text{total}} = 8140 + 204 \pi \]

Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[ 204 \pi \approx 204 \times 3.14159 = 640.718 \]

Thus,
\[ S_{\text{total}} \approx 8140 + 640.718 = 8780.718 \]

Rounded to two decimal places:
\[ S_{\text{total}} \approx 8780.72 \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{8780.72}
\]
