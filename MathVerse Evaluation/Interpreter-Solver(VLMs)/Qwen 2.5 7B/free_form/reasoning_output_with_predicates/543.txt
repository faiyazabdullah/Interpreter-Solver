QUESTION:
$f$ is a trigonometric function of the form $f(x)=a \cos (b x+c)+d$.
Below is the graph of $f(x)$. The function has a maximum point at $(-2,-3)$ and a minimum point at $(-2.5,-9)$. Find a formula for $f(x)$. Give an exact expression.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- The given points are \(A = (-2, -3)\) and \(B = (-2.5, -9)\).
- These points correspond to the maximum and minimum values of the trigonometric function \(f(x) = a \cos(bx + c) + d\).
- From the image, the maximum value is \(-3\) and the minimum value is \(-9\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify Amplitude and Midline:**
   - The amplitude \(A\) is half the distance between the maximum and minimum values:
     \[
     A = \frac{-3 - (-9)}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3.
     \]
   - The midline \(d\) is the average of the maximum and minimum values:
     \[
     d = \frac{-3 + (-9)}{2} = \frac{-12}{2} = -6.
     \]
   
2. **Determine Period and Frequency:**
   - The period \(T\) is the horizontal distance between two consecutive maximum or minimum points. From the graph, the period appears to be 1 unit.
   - The frequency \(b\) is related to the period by \(b = \frac{2\pi}{T}\):
     \[
     b = \frac{2\pi}{1} = 2\pi.
     \]

3. **Phase Shift:**
   - The phase shift \(c\) can be found using the horizontal distance from the origin to the first peak. Since the maximum occurs at \(x = -2\) and the period is 1, the phase shift is:
     \[
     c = -2.
     \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
- Combining these results, the function \(f(x)\) is:
  \[
  f(x) = 3 \cos(2\pi x - 2) - 6.
  \]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{3 \cos(2\pi x - 2) - 6}\]

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $3 \cos(2\pi x - 2) - 6$
