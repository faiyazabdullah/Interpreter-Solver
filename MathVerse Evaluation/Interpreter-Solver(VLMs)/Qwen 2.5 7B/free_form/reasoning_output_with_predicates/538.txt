QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $\left(\frac{3}{5} \pi, 8\right)$ and again at $\left(\frac{7}{5} \pi, 8\right)$. What is the period of the function? Give an exact value.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

- The given points \((\frac{3}{5}\pi, 8)\) and \((\frac{7}{5}\pi, 8)\) lie on the midline of the sine wave, indicating that these points have the same y-coordinate (8).
- These two points are symmetric about the center of the wave because they are equidistant from the vertical line passing through the midpoint of their x-values. This symmetry suggests that the distance between these two points is one period of the sine function.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. **Identify the Period:**
   - The distance between \(\frac{3}{5}\pi\) and \(\frac{7}{5}\pi\) is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{7}{5}\pi - \frac{3}{5}\pi = \frac{4}{5}\pi
     \]
   - Since these points are symmetric around the midpoint, the period \(T\) of the sine function is twice this distance:
     \[
     T = 2 \times \frac{4}{5}\pi = \frac{8}{5}\pi
     \]

2. **Verify Using the Midline:**
   - The midline of the sine wave is the horizontal line \(y = 8\). The general form of the sine function is \(y = A \sin(Bx + C) + D\), where \(D\) is the midline value.
   - Here, the midline \(D = 8\).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The period of the function is \(\frac{8}{5}\pi\).

**Final Answer: \[\boxed{\frac{8}{5}\pi}\]**
