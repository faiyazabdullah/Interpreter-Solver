QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 2 intersection points with axes, on the graph.


Find the centre of the circle. Write your answer in the form ( _ , _ )

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the problem step-by-step.

**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

From the given predicate `Equals(Center, (-4, -2))`, we know that the center of the circle is at the point \((-4, -2)\).

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

We are asked to find the center of the circle. According to the predicates, the center is already provided as \((-4, -2)\). 

**Justification:**

- We have been directly given the coordinates of the center using the predicate `Equals(Center, (-4, -2))`.
- There is no need to perform any further calculations or deductions as the coordinates are explicitly stated.

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

The center of the circle is \((-4, -2)\).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{(-4, -2)}\]
