QUESTION:
The graph shows the amount of water remaining in a bucket that was initially full before a hole was made in its side. What is the slope of the shown function that passes (0, 30)?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the slope of the function represented by the given graph, we need to find the rate of change of the quantity of water with respect to time.

### Step 1: Identify the Points on the Line
From the graph, we can see two points on the line:
- Point \(A\) at \( (0, 30) \)
- Point \(B\) at \( (44, 8) \)

### Step 2: Calculate the Slope Using the Two-Point Formula
The formula for the slope \(m\) between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

Substituting the coordinates of points \(A\) and \(B\):
\[ m = \frac{8 - 30}{44 - 0} \]

### Step 3: Perform the Calculation
First, calculate the numerator:
\[ 8 - 30 = -22 \]

Next, calculate the denominator:
\[ 44 - 0 = 44 \]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:
\[ m = \frac{-22}{44} = -\frac{1}{2} \]

### Conclusion:
The slope of the function passing through the points \((0, 30)\) and \((44, 8)\) is \(-\frac{1}{2}\).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{-\frac{1}{2}}\]
