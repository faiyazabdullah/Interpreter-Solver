QUESTION:
There is a quadratic function that opens upwards symmetric with respect to x=2. The vertex of the parabola is at the point (2,-2). Determine the intervals on which the functions are increasing, decreasing, or constant.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

- The vertex of the parabola is at (2, -2).
- The parabola is symmetric with respect to the line \(x = 2\).
- The parabola increases on the interval \([2, \infty)\).
- The parabola decreases on the interval \((-\infty, 2)\).

From the image, we can see that the vertex is at \((2, -2)\) and the parabola opens upwards. The symmetry axis is the vertical line \(x = 2\).

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. **Identify the Vertex and Symmetry Axis:**
   - The vertex of the parabola is given as \((2, -2)\).
   - The parabola is symmetric about the vertical line \(x = 2\).

2. **Determine the Intervals:**
   - The parabola decreases on the interval \((-\infty, 2)\) because it is a downward-opening parabola (as indicated by the decreasing behavior on the left side of the vertex).
   - The parabola increases on the interval \((2, \infty)\) because it is an upward-opening parabola (as indicated by the increasing behavior on the right side of the vertex).

3. **Verify the Behavior:**
   - The decreasing interval \((-\infty, 2)\) is consistent with the vertex being at \(x = 2\) and the parabola opening upwards.
   - The increasing interval \((2, \infty)\) is also consistent with the vertex being at \(x = 2\) and the parabola opening upwards.

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

Based on the above deductions, the intervals on which the parabola is increasing and decreasing are correctly identified.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{(-\infty, 2), (2, \infty)}\]
