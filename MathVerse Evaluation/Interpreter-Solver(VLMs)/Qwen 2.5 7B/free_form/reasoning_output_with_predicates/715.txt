QUESTION:
Find the surface area of the figure shown, rounded to two decimal places. Assume that the solid is three quarters of a cylinder. The height is 12 cm and radius is 5 cm.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the given geometric predicates and the image.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- Shape(Cylinder): The figure is a cylinder.
- RadiusOf(Cylinder, 5): The radius \( r \) of the cylinder is 5 cm.
- LengthOf(Cylinder, 12): The height \( h \) of the cylinder is 12 cm.
- RatioOf(AreaOf(Cylinder), AreaOf(Circle), 0.75): The surface area of the cylinder is 0.75 times the area of a circle.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Calculate the area of the base circle**:
   The formula for the area of a circle is:
   \[
   \text{Area of Circle} = \pi r^2
   \]
   Substituting \( r = 5 \):
   \[
   \text{Area of Circle} = \pi \times 5^2 = 25\pi \text{ cm}^2
   \]

2. **Calculate the lateral surface area of the cylinder**:
   The lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by:
   \[
   \text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi rh
   \]
   Substituting \( r = 5 \) and \( h = 12 \):
   \[
   \text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi \times 5 \times 12 = 120\pi \text{ cm}^2
   \]

3. **Calculate the total surface area of the cylinder**:
   The total surface area of the cylinder consists of the lateral surface area plus the areas of the two circular bases:
   \[
   \text{Total Surface Area} = 2 \times (\text{Area of Circle}) + \text{Lateral Surface Area}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Surface Area} = 2 \times 25\pi + 120\pi = 50\pi + 120\pi = 170\pi \text{ cm}^2
   \]

4. **Verify the ratio condition**:
   According to the given predicate, the surface area of the cylinder should be 0.75 times the area of the circle:
   \[
   \text{Surface Area of Cylinder} = 0.75 \times \text{Area of Circle}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Surface Area of Cylinder} = 0.75 \times 25\pi = 18.75\pi \text{ cm}^2
   \]

This step seems contradictory because we derived a different total surface area. Let's recheck the problem statement and the interpretation of the predicates. The problem states the figure is three-quarters of a cylinder, which suggests the surface area should be calculated accordingly.

5. **Recalculate the surface area considering it is three-quarters of a cylinder**:
   Since the figure is three-quarters of a cylinder, the total surface area would be:
   \[
   \text{Surface Area} = 0.75 \times \text{Total Surface Area of Cylinder}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Surface Area} = 0.75 \times 170\pi = 127.5\pi \text{ cm}^2
   \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
Rounding to two decimal places:
\[
127.5\pi \approx 127.5 \times 3.14159 \approx 402.13 \text{ cm}^2
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{402.13}
\]
