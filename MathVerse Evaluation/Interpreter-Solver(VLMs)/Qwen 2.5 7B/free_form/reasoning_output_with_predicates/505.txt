QUESTION:
Write an equation for the transformation of f(x)=|x| as shown in the figure, which passes (-2, 1) and are piecewise.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the equation for the piecewise transformation \( f(x) = |x| \) that passes through the point \((-2, 1)\), let's analyze the given geometric information and apply it to the function.

### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
From the predicates:
- Points \(A\) and \(B\) lie on the x-axis at \(A = (-4, 2)\) and \(B = (0, 2)\).
- Points \(C\) and \(D\) lie on a vertical line at \(C = (-2, 1)\).
- Line segments \(AB\), \(CD\), and \(DE\) are straight lines.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify the Shape and Transformation:**
   - The points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) suggest a V-shaped graph.
   - Since \(C\) lies on a vertical line and \(f(x) = |x|\) is symmetric about the y-axis, the function should be adjusted to pass through \((-2, 1)\).

2. **Adjust the Function:**
   - The standard \(f(x) = |x|\) does not pass through \((-2, 1)\). We need to shift the function horizontally and vertically.
   - The point \((-2, 1)\) suggests a horizontal shift to the right by 2 units and a vertical shift down by 1 unit.

3. **Form the Piecewise Function:**
   - The function \(f(x) = |x|\) needs to be shifted such that it passes through \((-2, 1)\).
   - The adjusted function can be written as:
     \[
     f(x) = |x + 2| - 1
     \]
   - This is derived because shifting \(f(x) = |x|\) to the left by 2 units results in \(f(x) = |x + 2|\), and then shifting it down by 1 unit gives us \(f(x) = |x + 2| - 1\).

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The equation for the transformation of \(f(x) = |x|\) that passes through \((-2, 1)\) is:
\[
f(x) = |x + 2| - 1
\]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{|x + 2| - 1}\]
