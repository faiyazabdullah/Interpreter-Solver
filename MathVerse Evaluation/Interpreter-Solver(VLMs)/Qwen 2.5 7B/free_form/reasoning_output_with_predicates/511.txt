QUESTION:
The x-intercept of the line is -3 and the y-intercept is 6. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

- The line passes through the points (-3, 0) and (0, 6).
- The x-intercept is -3.
- The y-intercept is 6.
- The dashed line divides the plane into two regions.
- The shaded region is on one side of the line.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. **Determine the equation of the line:**
   - Using the intercept form \( \frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1 \):
     \[
     \frac{x}{-3} + \frac{y}{6} = 1
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     \frac{x}{-3} + \frac{y}{6} = 1 \implies \frac{2x}{-6} + \frac{y}{6} = 1 \implies -\frac{2x}{6} + \frac{y}{6} = 1 \implies -\frac{x}{3} + \frac{y}{6} = 1
     \]
     \[
     \Rightarrow -2x + y = 6 \implies y = 2x + 6
     \]

2. **Determine the region described by the inequality:**
   - The line \( y = 2x + 6 \) divides the plane into two regions.
   - To determine which side of the line is shaded, test a point in each region.
   - Choose the origin (0, 0) as a test point:
     \[
     y = 2(0) + 6 = 6
     \]
     Since \( 6 \geq 6 \) is false, the origin is not in the shaded region.
   - Therefore, the shaded region is above the line.

3. **Formulate the inequality:**
   - The inequality that describes the shaded region is \( y > 2x + 6 \).

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

Final Answer: \[\boxed{y > 2x + 6}\]

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $y > 2x + 6$
