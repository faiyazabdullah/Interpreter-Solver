QUESTION:
Write an equation for the surface area of the above cylinder if the length is $L$, the major radius $R$ and minor radius $r$. You must factorise this expression fully.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**

- The image depicts a cylinder with a length \( L \), major radius \( R \), and minor radius \( r \).
- The surface area of a cylinder consists of two circular bases and a lateral surface.

**Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

1. **Area of the Circular Bases:**
   - The area of one circular base is given by \( \pi r^2 \). Since there are two bases, the total area of the bases is:
     \[
     2 \pi r^2
     \]

2. **Lateral Surface Area:**
   - The lateral surface area of a cylinder can be thought of as a rectangle that wraps around the cylinder. The height of this rectangle is the length of the cylinder \( L \), and the width is the circumference of the base, which is \( 2 \pi r \). Therefore, the lateral surface area is:
     \[
     L \times 2 \pi r = 2 \pi r L
     \]

3. **Total Surface Area:**
   - Adding the areas of the two bases and the lateral surface gives us the total surface area:
     \[
     2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r L
     \]

4. **Factorization:**
   - Both terms in the expression \( 2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r L \) have a common factor of \( 2 \pi r \):
     \[
     2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r L = 2 \pi r (r + L)
     \]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{2 \pi r (r + L)}
\]
