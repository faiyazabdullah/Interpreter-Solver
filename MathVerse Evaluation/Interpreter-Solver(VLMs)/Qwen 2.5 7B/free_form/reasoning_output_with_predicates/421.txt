QUESTION:
The total area is 6096. How much area is remaining?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's break down the problem step-by-step using the given information and predicates.

**Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**

From the image and the predicates, we have:
- Rectangle 1 has an area of 6000.
- Rectangle 2 has an area of 6096.
- The total area is the sum of the areas of Rectangle 1 and Rectangle 2.

We need to determine how much area remains after accounting for the areas of the two rectangles.

**Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

1. **Identify the total area**: The total area is given as 6096.
2. **Identify the areas of the individual rectangles**: Rectangle 1 has an area of 6000, and Rectangle 2 has an area of 6096.
3. **Calculate the remaining area**: Subtract the area of Rectangle 1 from the total area to find the area of Rectangle 2. This will give us the remaining area after accounting for Rectangle 1.

\[ \text{Remaining Area} = \text{Total Area} - \text{Area of Rectangle 1} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Area} = 6096 - 6000 \]
\[ \text{Remaining Area} = 96 \]

**Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**

The remaining area is 96.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{96}\]
