FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's analyze the given image and the predicates step by step.

1. **Critical Information Analysis:**
   - The image shows a dashed line passing through the origin (0,0).
   - There are two points plotted on the graph: one at (-3, -3) and another at (3, -3).
   - The shaded region appears to be the area below the dashed line.

2. **Deductive Reasoning Chain:**
   - Since the line passes through the origin, it can be represented by the equation \( y = mx \), where \( m \) is the slope.
   - The points (-3, -3) and (3, -3) lie on the line, indicating a horizontal line with a slope of 0.
   - Therefore, the equation of the line is \( y = 0 \).

3. **Conclusion and Selection:**
   - The shaded region is below the x-axis, which corresponds to the inequality \( y \leq 0 \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{y \leq 0}\]
