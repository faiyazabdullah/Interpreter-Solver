QUESTION:
There is a U-shape curve opens upwards and passes (0,0). Determine whether the graphed function is even, odd, or neither.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

- The given U-shaped curve opens upwards and passes through the point (0,0).
- The curve is symmetric with respect to the y-axis (Line(0,y)).
- Since the curve is symmetric about the y-axis, it implies that for any point (x, y) on the curve, the point (-x, y) is also on the curve.
- This symmetry suggests the function could be even, odd, or neither.
- To determine the nature of the function, we need to check if the function satisfies the conditions for being even or odd.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. **Even Function Property**: A function \( f(x) \) is even if \( f(-x) = f(x) \) for all \( x \) in the domain of \( f \).
2. **Odd Function Property**: A function \( f(x) \) is odd if \( f(-x) = -f(x) \) for all \( x \) in the domain of \( f \).
3. **Symmetry Analysis**: From the image, the curve appears to be symmetric about the y-axis. This means for any point \( (x, y) \) on the curve, the point \( (-x, y) \) is also on the curve. This suggests \( f(-x) = f(x) \).

**Conclusion from Symmetry**: The curve's symmetry about the y-axis indicates that \( f(x) \) is an even function because \( f(-x) = f(x) \).

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{\text{even}} \]
