QUESTION:
A boat travels S 14^\circ E for 12 km and then changes direction to S 49^\circ E for another 16 km.

Hence write down the bearing that the boat should travel on to return to the starting point.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the bearing the boat should travel on to return to the starting point after traveling 12 km at 14° East of South and then 16 km at 49° East of South.

### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The boat starts at point \( S \).
- It travels 12 km at 14° East of South, which means it moves 12 km in the direction S14°E.
- Then it travels 16 km at 49° East of South, which means it moves 16 km in the direction S49°E.

### Step 2: Determine the coordinates of the current position
We need to calculate the coordinates of the point after these two movements. We'll use trigonometry to find the north-south and east-west components of each leg of the journey.

#### First leg:
- Distance = 12 km
- Angle = 14° East of South
- Components:
  - North-South component: \( 12 \cos(14^\circ) \approx 12 \times 0.9703 \approx 11.64 \) km (Southward)
  - East-West component: \( 12 \sin(14^\circ) \approx 12 \times 0.2419 \approx 2.90 \) km (Eastward)

So, the position after the first leg is approximately 11.64 km South and 2.90 km East of the starting point \( S \).

#### Second leg:
- Distance = 16 km
- Angle = 49° East of South
- Components:
  - North-South component: \( 16 \cos(49^\circ) \approx 16 \times 0.6561 \approx 10.49 \) km (Southward)
  - East-West component: \( 16 \sin(49^\circ) \approx 16 \times 0.7547 \approx 12.08 \) km (Eastward)

Adding the components from both legs:
- Total North-South component: \( 11.64 + 10.49 \approx 22.13 \) km (Southward)
- Total East-West component: \( 2.90 + 12.08 \approx 14.98 \) km (Eastward)

The coordinates of the current position are approximately 22.13 km South and 14.98 km East of the starting point \( S \).

### Step 3: Determine the bearing back to the starting point
To find the bearing back to the starting point, we need to determine the angle with respect to the East direction from the current position.

The bearing is the angle measured clockwise from the North direction to the line connecting the starting point to the current position. This can be calculated using the arctangent function:
\[ \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\text{East-West component}}{\text{North-South component}}\right) \]
\[ \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{14.98}{22.13}\right) \approx \tan^{-1}(0.6767) \approx 34.3^\circ \]

Thus, the bearing back to the starting point is 34.3° West of North.

### Final Answer:
\[ \boxed{34.3^\circ \text{ West of North}} \]
