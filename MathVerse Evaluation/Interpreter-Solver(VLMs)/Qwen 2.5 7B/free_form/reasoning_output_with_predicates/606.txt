QUESTION:
The graph shows the cost, in dollars, of a phone call for different call durations. The x-axis represents call length (minutes), and the y-axis represents call cost.

What is the average rate of change?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the average rate of change of the call cost with respect to the call length, we need to calculate the slope of the line that passes through the given points.

Given points:
- \( A = (10, 10) \)
- \( B = (20, 19) \)

The formula for the slope \( m \) of a line passing through two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is:
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

Substituting the given points into the formula:
\[ m = \frac{19 - 10}{20 - 10} = \frac{9}{10} = 0.9 \]

Therefore, the average rate of change of the call cost with respect to the call length is:
\[ \boxed{0.9} \]
