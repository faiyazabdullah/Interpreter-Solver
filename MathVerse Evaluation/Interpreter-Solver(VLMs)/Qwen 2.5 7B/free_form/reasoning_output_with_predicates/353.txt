QUESTION:
An airplane is currently flying 35^\circ  south of east, as shown in the image.

The control tower orders the plane to change course by turning 7^\circ  to the left. How many degrees south of east is the new course that the plane is ordered to fly?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

- The point \( O \) is the origin, and lines \( ON \) and \( OA \) form a right angle.
- The angle \( \angle AON \) measures 35°.
- The airplane's initial course is 35° south of east.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. The initial course of the airplane is given as 35° south of east.
2. The control tower orders the plane to turn 7° to the left.
3. To determine the new course, we need to subtract 7° from the current 35°.
4. Calculation: \( 35° - 7° = 28° \).

Thus, the new course is 28° south of east.

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

Final Answer: \[\boxed{28}\]
