QUESTION:
A suspension bridge is being built. The top of the concrete tower is 35.5 metres above the bridge and the connection point for the main cable is 65.9 metres from the tower.

Assume that the concrete tower and the bridge are perpendicular to each other.

If the length of the cable is h metres, find h to two decimal places.

Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the given information and the Pythagorean theorem.

### Step 1: Identify the Key Elements
We have a right triangle formed by the tower, half the base, and the cable. Let's denote:
- The height of the tower (opposite side to the right angle) as \( L_t = 35.5 \) meters.
- The horizontal distance from the center of the base to the point where the cable meets the base (half the base length) as \( L_b/2 = 65.9 / 2 = 32.95 \) meters.
- The length of the cable as \( L_c \).

### Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem
In the right triangle, the relationship between the sides is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ L_c^2 = L_t^2 + \left(\frac{L_b}{2}\right)^2 \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ L_c^2 = 35.5^2 + 32.95^2 \]

Calculate each term:
\[ 35.5^2 = 1260.25 \]
\[ 32.95^2 = 1084.2025 \]

Add these values together:
\[ L_c^2 = 1260.25 + 1084.2025 = 2344.4525 \]

Take the square root to find \( L_c \):
\[ L_c = \sqrt{2344.4525} \approx 48.43 \]

### Step 3: Round to Two Decimal Places
Rounding \( 48.43 \) to two decimal places gives us:
\[ L_c \approx 48.43 \]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{48.43}
\]
