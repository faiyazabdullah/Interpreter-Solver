QUESTION:
In remote locations, photographers must keep track of their position from their base. One morning a photographer sets out from base, represented by point B, to the edge of an ice shelf at point S on a bearing of 055°. She then walked on a bearing of 145° to point P, which is 916 metres due east of base.

If the photographer were to walk back to her base from point P, what is the total distance she would have travelled? Round your answer to one decimal place.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Key Information:**
   - Point \( B \) is the base.
   - Point \( S \) is located on a bearing of \( 055^\circ \) from \( B \).
   - The photographer walks from \( S \) to \( P \) on a bearing of \( 145^\circ \).
   - The distance \( BP = 916 \) meters.
   - We need to calculate the total distance walked if the photographer returns from \( P \) to \( B \).

2. **Analyze the Bearings:**
   - The bearing from \( B \) to \( S \) is \( 055^\circ \). This means the angle \( \angle NBS = 55^\circ \).
   - The bearing from \( S \) to \( P \) is \( 145^\circ \). Since the angle \( \angle NSP = 145^\circ \), the angle \( \angle SBP = 35^\circ \) because the sum of the angles around point \( S \) must be \( 360^\circ \).

3. **Determine the Direction of \( P \):**
   - The angle \( \angle BSP = 35^\circ \).
   - Therefore, the direction of \( P \) relative to \( S \) is such that \( \angle SBP = 35^\circ \) and \( \angle BSP = 35^\circ \).

4. **Calculate the Total Distance Walked:**
   - The photographer walks from \( B \) to \( S \) and then from \( S \) to \( P \). The distance \( BP = 916 \) meters.
   - If the photographer returns directly from \( P \) to \( B \), the distance \( PB = 916 \) meters.

5. **Sum the Distances:**
   - The total distance walked is the sum of the distances \( BS \), \( SP \), and \( PB \).
   - From the given information, \( BP = 916 \) meters.

Therefore, the total distance walked by the photographer is:
\[ BS + SP + PB = 916 \text{ meters} \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{916}
\]
