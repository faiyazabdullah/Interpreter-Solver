QUESTION:
There is a curve goes through (-4,0), (0,2), and (4,0). The points at (-4,0) and (4,0) are both solid points. Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given geometric information step by step:

1. **Identify the Points and Their Coordinates:**
   - Point \(A\) lies on the x-axis at \((-4, 0)\).
   - Point \(B\) lies on the curve at \((0, 2)\).
   - Point \(C\) lies on the x-axis at \((4, 0)\).

2. **Understand the Curve:**
   - The curve passes through the points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).
   - The curve is symmetric about the y-axis because it passes through points \(A\) and \(C\) which are equidistant from the y-axis.
   - Since the curve is symmetric and passes through \((0, 2)\), it suggests that the curve could be a parabola opening downwards.

3. **Determine the Domain and Range:**
   - The domain of the function is the set of all x-values for which the function is defined. From the given points, the domain is \([-4, 4]\) because these are the x-coordinates of points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).
   - The range of the function is the set of all y-values that the function can take. From the given points, the maximum y-value is 2 (at point \(B\)) and the minimum y-value is 0 (at points \(A\) and \(C\)). Therefore, the range is \([0, 2]\).

4. **Formulate the Final Answer:**
   - The domain is \([-4, 4]\).
   - The range is \([0, 2]\).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{[-4, 4], [0, 2]}\]
