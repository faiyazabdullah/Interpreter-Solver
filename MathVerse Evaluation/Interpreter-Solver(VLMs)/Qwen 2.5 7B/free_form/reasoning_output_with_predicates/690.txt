QUESTION:
Consider the halfpipe with a diameter of 8 cm.

Find its volume, rounding to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS
- The given shape is a halfpipe.
- The diameter of the halfpipe is 8 cm, so the radius is \( r = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) cm.
- The length of the halfpipe (the straight part) is 20 cm.
- The formula for the volume \( V \) of a half-cylinder is \( V = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

### STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN
- Since the diameter is 8 cm, the radius \( r \) is 4 cm.
- The length of the straight part is 20 cm, which acts as the height \( h \) of the cylinder.
- Substitute \( r = 4 \) cm and \( h = 20 \) cm into the volume formula for a half-cylinder: 
  \[
  V = \frac{1}{2} \pi (4)^2 (20)
  \]
- Simplify the expression:
  \[
  V = \frac{1}{2} \pi (16) (20) = 160 \pi
  \]
- Calculate the numerical value:
  \[
  160 \pi \approx 502.65
  \]
- Round to two decimal places:
  \[
  502.65 \approx 502.65
  \]

### STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION
- The volume of the halfpipe, rounded to two decimal places, is approximately 502.65 cubic centimeters.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{502.65}\]
