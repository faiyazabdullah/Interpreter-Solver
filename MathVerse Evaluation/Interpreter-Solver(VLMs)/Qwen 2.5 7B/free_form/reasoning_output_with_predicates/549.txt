QUESTION:
Takoda is watching the tides off the coast of Cape Cod. For two days, Takoda records the height of the water, $h$, in feet. His results are shown in the graph below, where $t$ corresponds to the number of hours after 12:00 a.m. According to Takoda's research, approximately how much time passes between two consecutive high tides?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the time that passes between two consecutive high tides, we need to analyze the given graph and extract the relevant information.

**Step 1: Analyze the Graph**
The graph shows the height \( h \) of the water over time \( t \). High tides occur at the peaks of the sine wave, and low tides occur at the troughs. From the graph, we can see that the highest points (peaks) of the sine wave correspond to the high tides.

**Step 2: Identify the Period of the Sine Wave**
The period of a sine wave is the horizontal distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs. By observing the graph, we can see that the first peak occurs at \( t = 4 \) and the next peak occurs at \( t = 16 \).

**Step 3: Calculate the Time Difference Between Two Consecutive High Tides**
The time difference between two consecutive high tides is the period of the sine wave. The period \( T \) is given by the difference in time between two consecutive peaks:
\[ T = 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 4: Conclusion**
The time that passes between two consecutive high tides is 12 hours.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{12}\]
