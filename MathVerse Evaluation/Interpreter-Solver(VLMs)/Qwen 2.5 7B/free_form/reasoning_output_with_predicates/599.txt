QUESTION:
The graph shows $y_1=x^3$ passing (0,0) and a vertical or horizontal translation $y_2$ passing (-2,0). The blue line is solid while the red line is dotted. Write an equation for $y_2$ as shown in the graph.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Analyze the given information**

We have two lines:
1. \( y_1 = x^3 \)
2. \( y_2 = (x + 2)^3 \)

From the graph, it is clear that \( y_1 = x^3 \) passes through the origin (0,0). The red line \( y_2 \) has a vertical translation of the blue line \( y_1 \) by 2 units to the left. This means we need to shift the graph of \( y_1 \) horizontally to the left by 2 units.

**Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

1. We know \( y_1 = x^3 \).
2. To find \( y_2 \), we replace \( x \) with \( x + 2 \) in the equation of \( y_1 \):
   \[
   y_2 = (x + 2)^3
   \]

This transformation shifts the graph of \( y_1 \) to the left by 2 units. Since the graph of \( y_2 \) passes through the point (-2,0), we can confirm that the equation is correct.

**Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**

The equation for \( y_2 \) is:
\[
y_2 = (x + 2)^3
\]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{(x + 2)^3}\]
