QUESTION:
There is a curve goes through (-4,1), (-1,3), and (0,0). Estimate the intervals on which the function is increasing or decreasing.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the intervals on which the function is increasing or decreasing, we need to analyze the derivative of the function. Since the graph is given, we can infer the behavior of the function by examining the slope of the tangent lines at various points.

1. **Identify Key Points:**
   - The function has a maximum point around \( x = -2 \).
   - The function has a minimum point around \( x = 1 \).

2. **Determine the Intervals:**
   - To the left of \( x = -2 \), the slope of the tangent line is positive, indicating the function is increasing.
   - Between \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 1 \), the slope of the tangent line is negative, indicating the function is decreasing.
   - To the right of \( x = 1 \), the slope of the tangent line is positive again, indicating the function is increasing.

Therefore, the function is increasing on the intervals \( (-\infty, -2) \cup (1, \infty) \) and decreasing on the interval \( (-2, 1) \).

Final Answer: \(\boxed{(-\infty, -2) \cup (1, \infty), \text{decreasing on } (-2, 1)}\)
