QUESTION:
Consider the circle on the graph. Its center at the origin and its radius is 7. State the equation of the circle.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

- The image shows a circle centered at the origin (0,0).
- The radius of the circle is given as 7.
- The equation of a circle with center (h,k) and radius r is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

Given that the center of the circle is at the origin (0,0) and the radius is 7, we substitute \(h=0\), \(k=0\), and \(r=7\) into the circle's equation.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

- Since the center of the circle is at (0,0) and the radius is 7, the equation becomes:
  \[
  (x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 = 7^2
  \]
- Simplifying this, we get:
  \[
  x^2 + y^2 = 49
  \]

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

- The equation of the circle is derived directly from the given center and radius.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{x^2 + y^2 = 49}\]
