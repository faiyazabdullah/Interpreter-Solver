QUESTION:
A safety fence is constructed to protect tourists from the danger of an eroding castle toppling down. At point A, the surveyor takes an angle measurement to the top of the tower of 10°. She then walks 29 meters towards the tower and takes another reading of 22° at point B.
Hence or otherwise, find the value of h to the nearest metre.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the given information and geometric properties.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- We have two angles at points A and B: \( \angle A = 10^\circ \) and \( \angle B = 22^\circ \).
- The distance AB is 29 meters.
- We need to find the height \( h \) of the tower.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify Triangles and Their Relationships:**
   - Consider the triangles formed by the surveyor’s positions and the top of the tower.
   - Let's denote the top of the tower as point C.

2. **Formulate Equations Using Tangent Function:**
   - In triangle ABC:
     \[
     \tan(\angle BAC) = \frac{h}{AB}
     \]
     Since \(\angle BAC = 10^\circ\) and \(AB = 29\) meters:
     \[
     \tan(10^\circ) = \frac{h}{29}
     \]
     \[
     h = 29 \cdot \tan(10^\circ)
     \]

3. **Calculate \( h \):**
   - Using a calculator, \(\tan(10^\circ) \approx 0.1763\):
     \[
     h = 29 \times 0.1763 \approx 5.0127 \text{ meters}
     \]

4. **Rounding to the Nearest Meter:**
   - The height \( h \) rounded to the nearest meter is approximately 5 meters.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
- Based on the calculations, the height of the tower is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]
