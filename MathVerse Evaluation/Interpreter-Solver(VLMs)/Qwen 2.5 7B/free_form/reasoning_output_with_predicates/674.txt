QUESTION:
A cylinder with a radius of 2.5cm and a height of 10cm contains two identical spherical balls that fit exactly inside it. What is the surface area of each ball? Give your answer correct to one decimal place.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Identify the given information and required calculations

- We have a cylinder with a diameter of 2.5 cm and a height of 10 cm.
- There are two identical spherical balls inscribed in the cylinder such that they fit exactly inside it.
- We need to find the surface area of each sphere.

### Step 2: Determine the radius of the spheres

Since the spheres fit exactly inside the cylinder, their diameters must equal the diameter of the cylinder. Therefore, the diameter of each sphere is 2.5 cm. Consequently, the radius \( r \) of each sphere is half of the diameter:

\[
r = \frac{2.5}{2} = 1.25 \text{ cm}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the surface area of each sphere

The formula for the surface area \( S \) of a sphere is given by:

\[
S = 4\pi r^2
\]

Substituting the radius \( r = 1.25 \text{ cm} \):

\[
S = 4\pi (1.25)^2
\]

First, calculate \( (1.25)^2 \):

\[
(1.25)^2 = 1.5625
\]

Then, multiply by \( 4\pi \):

\[
S = 4\pi \times 1.5625 = 6.25\pi
\]

### Step 4: Provide the final answer

Using the value of \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):

\[
S \approx 6.25 \times 3.14159 = 19.6349375
\]

Rounding to one decimal place:

\[
S \approx 19.6
\]

### Final Answer:

\[
\boxed{19.6}
\]
