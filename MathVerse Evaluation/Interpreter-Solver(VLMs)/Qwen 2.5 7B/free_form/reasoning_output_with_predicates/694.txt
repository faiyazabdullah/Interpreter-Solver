QUESTION:
Xavier's mother told him to drink 4 glasses of water each day. She gave him a cylindrical glass with radius 4 cm.

If Xavier follows this drinking routine for a week, how many litres of water would he drink altogether?

Round your answer to one decimal place.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's break it down into manageable steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the cylindrical glass:**
   - The radius \( r \) of the base of the cylinder is given as 4 cm.
   - The height \( h \) of the cylinder is given as 11 cm.
   - The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
     \[
     V = \pi r^2 h
     \]
   - Substitute the given values:
     \[
     V = \pi (4 \text{ cm})^2 (11 \text{ cm}) = \pi \times 16 \text{ cm}^2 \times 11 \text{ cm} = 176\pi \text{ cm}^3
     \]

2. **Convert the volume from cubic centimeters to liters:**
   - There are 1000 cubic centimeters in a liter.
   - Therefore, the volume in liters is:
     \[
     V_{\text{l}} = \frac{176\pi \text{ cm}^3}{1000} = 0.176\pi \text{ L}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water Xavier drinks in a week:**
   - Xavier drinks 4 glasses of water each day.
   - The number of days in a week is 7.
   - The total volume of water consumed per week is:
     \[
     \text{Total Volume} = 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 7 \text{ days} \times 0.176\pi \text{ L/glass} = 28 \times 0.176\pi \text{ L} = 4.928\pi \text{ L}
     \]

4. **Approximate the value:**
   - Using \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
     \[
     4.928\pi \approx 4.928 \times 3.14159 \approx 15.51 \text{ L}
     \]

5. **Round to one decimal place:**
   - The final answer is:
     \[
     \boxed{15.5}
     \]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{15.5}\]
