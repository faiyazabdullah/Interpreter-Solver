QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 2 intersection points with axes, on the graph.

Find the centre of the circle. Write your answer in the form ( _ , _ ).

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the center of the circle, let's analyze the given information:

1. **Identify Key Properties:**
   - The circle passes through four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
   - Point \(O\) is the center of the circle.
   - \(O\) is equidistant from \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
   - The circle intersects the x-axis at two points, say \(P\) and \(Q\).

2. **Use the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem:**
   - Since \(O\) is equidistant from \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), \(OA = OB = OC = OD\). This means that the point \(O\) lies on the perpendicular bisectors of the chords \(AB\), \(AC\), and \(AD\).

3. **Identify the Center:**
   - The perpendicular bisectors of \(AB\), \(AC\), and \(AD\) will intersect at point \(O\), which is the center of the circle.

4. **Visualize the Intersection Points:**
   - From the image, it appears that the circle intersects the x-axis at \(x = -1\) and \(x = 3\). These points are symmetric about the y-axis, suggesting that the center of the circle is at the midpoint of these points.

5. **Calculate the Center:**
   - The x-coordinate of the center \(O\) is the average of \(-1\) and \(3\):
     \[
     O_x = \frac{-1 + 3}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1
     \]
   - The y-coordinate of the center \(O\) is 0 because the circle is centered on the x-axis (as indicated by the symmetry).

Therefore, the center of the circle is at \((1, 0)\).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{(1, 0)}\]
