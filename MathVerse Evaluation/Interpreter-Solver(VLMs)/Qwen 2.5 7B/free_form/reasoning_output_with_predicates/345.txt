QUESTION:
Luke sailed for 116 kilometres on a bearing of 231^\circ .

If w is how many kilometres west he has sailed from his starting point, find $w$ to one decimal place.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance \( w \) Luke sailed west from his starting point. We know that he sailed for 116 kilometers on a bearing of 231°. The bearing of 231° means that the direction of his journey makes an angle of 231° clockwise from the north.

First, let's break down the angle into its components. The angle 231° can be expressed as:
\[ 231^\circ = 180^\circ + 51^\circ \]
This means that the bearing of 231° is 51° south of west. Therefore, the angle between the north-south line and the direction of travel is 51°. This forms a right triangle where the hypotenuse is 116 km and the angle opposite the side \( w \) is 51°.

Using the sine function in trigonometry, we have:
\[ \sin(51^\circ) = \frac{w}{116} \]
Thus,
\[ w = 116 \cdot \sin(51^\circ) \]

Now, we calculate \( \sin(51^\circ) \):
\[ \sin(51^\circ) \approx 0.7771 \]
So,
\[ w = 116 \cdot 0.7771 \approx 90.16 \]

Rounding to one decimal place, we get:
\[ w \approx 90.2 \]

Therefore, the distance Luke sailed west is:
\[ \boxed{90.2} \]
