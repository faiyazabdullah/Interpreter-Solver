FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the period of the given trigonometric function, let's analyze the information provided and the characteristics of the graph.

### Step 1: Identify Key Points
- The function intersects its midline at the point \( (1.25, -2.75) \).
- The function has a minimum point at the point \( (4.75, -6.25) \).

### Step 2: Understand Trigonometric Function Characteristics
A standard sine or cosine function has the form:
\[ y = A \sin(Bx - C) + D \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amplitude,
- \( B \) affects the period,
- \( C \) is the phase shift,
- \( D \) is the vertical shift (midline),
- The period \( T \) is given by \( T = \frac{2\pi}{|B|} \).

From the given points, we know:
- The midline \( D = -2.75 \).
- The minimum point indicates a low point of the function, which is typically \( -A \) for a sine function.

### Step 3: Determine the Period
The period of a trigonometric function is the horizontal distance between two consecutive maximum or minimum points. In this case, the minimum point at \( (4.75, -6.25) \) and the next relevant point (which would be the next minimum point) can help us calculate the period.

Assuming the function is a standard sine function, the period \( T \) is the distance between two consecutive minimum points. Letâ€™s calculate the distance between these points:

The x-coordinates of the points are 1.25 and 4.75. The distance between these points is:
\[ 4.75 - 1.25 = 3.5 \]

This distance corresponds to half the period because the function goes from a minimum to the next minimum, which is half a full period.

Thus, the full period \( T \) is:
\[ T = 2 \times 3.5 = 7 \]

### Conclusion
The period of the function is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]
