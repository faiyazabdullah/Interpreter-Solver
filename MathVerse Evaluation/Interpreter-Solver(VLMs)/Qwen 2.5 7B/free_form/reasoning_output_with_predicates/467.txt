QUESTION:
Consider the graph of the circle, which has 2 intersection points with axes, below.

State the equation of the circle shown in the graph.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image, we see a circle centered at the origin \((0,0)\). We also have four given points that lie on the circle: \((3, -4)\), \((-1, -4)\), \((1, -1)\), and \((1, -7)\).

Given:
- Radius of Circle(1) is \(3\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify the Center:**
   Since the circle is centered at the origin \((0,0)\), the general form of the equation of the circle is:
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 = r^2
   \]
   Here, \(r\) is the radius.

2. **Substitute the Known Radius:**
   Given the radius \(r = 3\):
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 = 3^2
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 = 9
   \]

3. **Verify with Given Points:**
   - For point \((3, -4)\):
     \[
     3^2 + (-4)^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 \quad \text{(not equal to 9)}
     \]
     This indicates there might be a misunderstanding since the point does not lie on the circle with radius 3 centered at the origin.
   - For point \((-1, -4)\):
     \[
     (-1)^2 + (-4)^2 = 1 + 16 = 17 \quad \text{(not equal to 9)}
     \]
     Again, this point does not lie on the circle with radius 3 centered at the origin.
   - For point \((1, -1)\):
     \[
     1^2 + (-1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2 \quad \text{(not equal to 9)}
     \]
     This point does not lie on the circle either.
   - For point \((1, -7)\):
     \[
     1^2 + (-7)^2 = 1 + 49 = 50 \quad \text{(not equal to 9)}
     \]
     This point also does not lie on the circle.

It appears there was a mistake in the problem statement or the given points. However, if we strictly follow the given radius and center, the equation of the circle should be:

\[
x^2 + y^2 = 9
\]

### Conclusion
The equation of the circle, given the radius and center, is:
\[
\boxed{x^2 + y^2 = 9}
\]
