QUESTION:
Function f in blue is a parabola as $y=x^2$. Function g in red can be thought of as a translated (shifted) version of f(x)=x^2. Write the equation for g(x).

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

- We have two parabolas, \( f \) and \( g \), both in standard form \( y = ax^2 \).
- The vertex of \( f \) is at \( (0, 0) \), which means it's \( f(x) = x^2 \).
- The vertex of \( g \) is at \( (-3, -5) \), which means it's shifted horizontally and vertically from \( f \).

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. Since \( f(x) = x^2 \) has its vertex at \( (0, 0) \), the general form is \( y = x^2 \).
2. Parabola \( g \) has its vertex at \( (-3, -5) \). In the form \( y = a(x-h)^2 + k \), where \( (h, k) \) is the vertex, we get \( g(x) = a(x+3)^2 - 5 \).
3. To determine \( a \), note that the shape and direction of \( g \) are the same as \( f \), so \( a = 1 \).

Thus, the equation for \( g(x) \) is:
\[ g(x) = (x+3)^2 - 5 \]

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

Final Answer: \[\boxed{(x+3)^2 - 5}\]
