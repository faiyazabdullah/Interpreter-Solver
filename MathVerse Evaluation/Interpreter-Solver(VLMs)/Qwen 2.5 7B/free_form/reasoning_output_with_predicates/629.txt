QUESTION:
The linear function is graphed. The x-axis represents Time (minutes) and the y-axis represents Water (liters). The slope is less than 0. It intersects the x-axis at (5,0) and the y-axis at (0,360). Archimedes drained the water in his tub.
The amount of water left in the tub (in liters) as a function of time (in minutes) is graphed.
How much water was initially in the tub?

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the initial amount of water in the tub, let's analyze the given information step-by-step.

1. **Identify the given points and their coordinates:**
   - The point where the line intersects the x-axis is (5, 0).
   - The point where the line intersects the y-axis is (0, 360).

2. **Determine the slope of the line:**
   - The slope \( m \) of a line passing through two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
     \[
     m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
     \]
   - Substituting the points (0, 360) and (5, 0):
     \[
     m = \frac{0 - 360}{5 - 0} = \frac{-360}{5} = -72
     \]
   - The slope of the line is -72, which confirms that the slope is indeed less than 0.

3. **Formulate the equation of the line:**
   - The general form of the equation of a line is:
     \[
     y = mx + b
     \]
   - Here, \( m = -72 \) and \( b = 360 \) (since it passes through (0, 360)).
   - Therefore, the equation of the line is:
     \[
     y = -72x + 360
     \]

4. **Determine the initial amount of water:**
   - The initial amount of water corresponds to the y-intercept of the line, which is 360 liters.

Thus, the initial amount of water in the tub is:
\[
\boxed{360}
\]
