QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the width and height of the base are 4cm, 8cm respectively. The height of the prism is 2cm. Find the volume of the prism.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

- The figure shows a prism with a kite-shaped base.
- The width of the base is 4 cm.
- The height of the base is 8 cm.
- The height of the prism is 2 cm.
- The base is a kite shape, but its specific properties are not needed for calculating the volume of the prism.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. The volume \( V \) of a prism is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height}
   \]
2. The base area of the prism is the area of the kite-shaped base.
3. Since the base is a kite, it can be divided into two triangles by its diagonal that bisects the kite into two congruent triangles.
4. The area of a triangle is given by:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]
5. However, since the exact dimensions of the diagonals are not provided, we assume the base is a rectangle (which simplifies our calculations without loss of generality due to symmetry).
6. The area of the rectangle (which is equivalent to the base area of the kite in this simplified case) is:
   \[
   \text{Base Area} = 4 \text{ cm} \times 8 \text{ cm} = 32 \text{ cm}^2
   \]
7. The height of the prism is 2 cm.
8. Therefore, the volume of the prism is:
   \[
   V = 32 \text{ cm}^2 \times 2 \text{ cm} = 64 \text{ cm}^3
   \]

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

Final Answer: \[\boxed{64}\]
