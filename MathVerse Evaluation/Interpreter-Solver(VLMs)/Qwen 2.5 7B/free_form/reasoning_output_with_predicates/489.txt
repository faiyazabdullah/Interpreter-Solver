QUESTION:
There are two curves with a vertical asymptote x=3. One curve passes (1,0), and another curve passes (4,0). Estimate the intervals on which the function is increasing or decreasing.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- The graph shows two curves with a vertical asymptote at \(x = 3\).
- One curve passes through \((1, 0)\).
- Another curve passes through \((4, 0)\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify the asymptotes and intersections:**
   - The vertical asymptote is at \(x = 3\).
   - The points \((1, 0)\) and \((4, 0)\) lie on the x-axis, indicating these are x-intercepts of the curves.
   
2. **Determine the nature of the curves:**
   - Since the curves approach the asymptote \(x = 3\) but do not cross it, they must be approaching from opposite sides.
   - The curves appear to be symmetric about the y-axis, suggesting they might be transformations of the same base function.

3. **Analyze the behavior near the asymptote:**
   - As \(x\) approaches \(3\) from the left, the curve must be decreasing because it approaches the negative side.
   - As \(x\) approaches \(3\) from the right, the curve must be increasing because it approaches the positive side.

4. **Estimate the intervals:**
   - From the graph, it appears that the curve decreases from \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\) and then increases from \(x = 3\) to \(x = 4\).

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
Based on the analysis, the function is decreasing on the interval \([1, 3]\) and increasing on the interval \([3, 4]\).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{[1, 3] \text{ (decreasing)}, [3, 4] \text{ (increasing)}}\]
