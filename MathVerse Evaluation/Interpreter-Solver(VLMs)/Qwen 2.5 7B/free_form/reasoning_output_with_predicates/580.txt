QUESTION:
In a memory study, subjects are asked to memorize some content and recall as much as they can remember each day thereafter. Each day, Maximilian finds that he has forgotten $15 \%$ of what he could recount the day before. Lucy also took part in the study. The given graphs represent the percentage of content that Maximilian (gray) and Lucy (black) could remember after $t$ days. y-axis labels "days" and x-axis labels "recall percentage"

On each day, what percentage of the previous day's content did Lucy forget?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the percentage of the previous day's content that Lucy forgot each day, let's analyze the graph and the given information step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Graph
The graph shows two curves representing the percentage of content remembered by Maximilian and Lucy over time. The black curve represents Lucy's recall percentage, which decreases more slowly than Maximilian's gray curve. 

### Step 2: Understand the Decay Model
Each day, Maximilian finds that he has forgotten \(15\%\) of what he could recount the day before. This means that if \(P_n\) is the percentage of content Maximilian remembers on day \(n\), then:
\[ P_{n+1} = P_n - 0.15P_n = 0.85P_n \]

Similarly, since Lucy's curve decreases less steeply, her decay rate is different. Let \(Q_n\) be the percentage of content Lucy remembers on day \(n\). If Lucy forgot a consistent percentage \(r\) each day, then:
\[ Q_{n+1} = Q_n - rQ_n = (1-r)Q_n \]

From the graph, it is clear that Lucy's recall percentage does not decrease as quickly as Maximilian's, indicating a smaller \(r\).

### Step 3: Determine the Decay Rate for Lucy
To find \(r\), we need to compare the rates of decay visually. The black curve for Lucy shows a slower decline compared to the gray curve for Maximilian. By examining the slopes of the curves, we can infer that Lucy's decay rate \(r\) is less than 0.15.

### Step 4: Estimate the Decay Rate
By comparing the slopes and the initial values, we can estimate that Lucy's decay rate \(r\) is approximately \(0.05\). This means that each day, Lucy forgets \(5\%\) of the content she could recount the day before.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{5\%}
\]
