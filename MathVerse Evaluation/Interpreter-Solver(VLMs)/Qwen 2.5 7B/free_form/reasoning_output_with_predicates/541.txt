QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a minimum point at $(1,1.5)$ and an amplitude of 1.5. What is the midline equation of the function?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- The graph shows a trigonometric function with a minimum point at $(1, 1.5)$.
- The amplitude of the function is given as 1.5.
- The y-coordinate of the minimum point is 1.5, which corresponds to the amplitude of the function.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**
- The amplitude of the function is 1.5, which means the distance from the midline to the maximum or minimum points is 1.5.
- Since the minimum point is at $(1, 1.5)$, the midline must be halfway between the minimum and maximum values.
- The midline is the horizontal line that runs through the middle of the oscillations.
- If the amplitude is 1.5, then the maximum point would be at $y = 1.5 + 1.5 = 3$.
- Therefore, the midline is the average of the maximum and minimum y-values, which is $\frac{3 + 1.5}{2} = 2.25$.

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
- The midline equation of the function is $y = 2.25$.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{2.25}\]
