QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 3.3\right)$, and it has a maximum point at $(-2 \pi, 9.8)$. What is the amplitude of the function?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- The graph shows a trigonometric function intersecting its midline at $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 3.3\right)$.
- The function has a maximum point at $(-2 \pi, 9.8)$.
- The midline is represented by the horizontal line passing through $(0, 3.3)$.
- The amplitude is half the distance between the maximum and minimum values of the function.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**
1. Identify the midline: The midline is the horizontal line passing through $(0, 3.3)$, which represents the average value of the function.
2. Determine the maximum value: The maximum value of the function is given as $9.8$.
3. Calculate the amplitude: The amplitude is half the distance between the maximum and midline values. The midline is at $y = 3.3$, so the distance between the maximum value ($9.8$) and the midline ($3.3$) is $9.8 - 3.3 = 6.5$.
4. Therefore, the amplitude is $\frac{6.5}{2} = 3.25$.

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
- The amplitude of the function is $3.25$.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{3.25}\]
