QUESTION:
The graph shows the price change, in dollars, of a toy for different levels of demand. The x-axis represents quantity (thousand units), and the y-axis represents price.

What is the average rate of change?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the average rate of change of the price with respect to the quantity, we need to calculate the slope of the line passing through the given points. The formula for the slope \( m \) between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:

\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

From the image, the points on the line are approximately:
- Point 1: \((6, 16)\)
- Point 2: \((16, 22)\)

Using these points, we can substitute into the slope formula:

\[ m = \frac{22 - 16}{16 - 6} = \frac{6}{10} = 0.6 \]

This means that for every thousand units increase in quantity, the price increases by $0.60.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{0.6}\]
