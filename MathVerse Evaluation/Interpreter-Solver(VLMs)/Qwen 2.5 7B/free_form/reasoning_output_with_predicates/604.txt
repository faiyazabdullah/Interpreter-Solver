QUESTION:
The graph with 2 linear functions shows the progress of two competitors in a cycling race. In the graph, the x-axis represents Time and the y-axis represents Distance.

How much faster is Oliver traveling?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine how much faster Oliver is traveling compared to Justin, we need to calculate their speeds and then find the difference.

### Step 1: Identify the slopes of the lines representing Oliver and Justin's distances over time.
The slope of a line in a distance-time graph represents the speed of the object.

#### Line for Oliver:
The line passes through points \((0, 0)\) and \((5, 175)\).

The slope \(m\) of the line passing through \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

For Oliver:
\[ m_{Oliver} = \frac{175 - 0}{5 - 0} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \]

So, Oliver's speed is 35 units per time unit.

#### Line for Justin:
The line passes through points \((0, 0)\) and \((5, 125)\).

For Justin:
\[ m_{Justin} = \frac{125 - 0}{5 - 0} = \frac{125}{5} = 25 \]

So, Justin's speed is 25 units per time unit.

### Step 2: Calculate the difference in their speeds.
The difference in speed between Oliver and Justin is:
\[ \text{Difference} = m_{Oliver} - m_{Justin} = 35 - 25 = 10 \]

### Step 3: Formulate the final answer.
The speed of Oliver is 10 units per time unit faster than Justin.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{10}\]
