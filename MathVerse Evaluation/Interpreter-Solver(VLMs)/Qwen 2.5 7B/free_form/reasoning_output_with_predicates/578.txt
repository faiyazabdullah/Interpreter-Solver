QUESTION:
Peter received a lump sum payment of $\$ 50000$ for an insurance claim (and decided not to put it in a savings account).

Every month, he withdraws $5 \%$ of the remaining funds.

The funds after $x$ months is shown below. The curve in the graph passes (0,5). y-axis labels"y('0000s)"

How much would the first withdrawal be?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's start by analyzing the given information and the predicates provided:

1. **Geometric Relationships and Measurements**:
   - Point \(O\) is the origin.
   - Points \(A\) and \(B\) lie on lines passing through \(O\).
   - Length of \(OA\) is 20 units.
   - Length of \(OB\) is 5 units.
   - The area of triangle \(OAB\) is 50 square units.
   - The circumference of the circle centered at \(O\) is \(2 \times 3.14159265359\) units.
   - \(OA\) and \(OB\) are perpendicular to each other.
   - Angle \(AOB\) measures 90 degrees.
   - The radius of the circle is 5 units.

2. **Given Predicates**:
   - The curve in the graph represents the relationship between the remaining funds and the number of months.
   - The initial amount is \$50,000.
   - Every month, Peter withdraws 5% of the remaining funds.
   - The graph shows that after some months, the remaining funds are approximately \$15,000.

We need to determine the first withdrawal amount. Let's denote the initial amount as \(P_0 = \$50,000\).

After each month, Peter withdraws 5% of the remaining funds. Therefore, the remaining funds after \(x\) months can be expressed as:
\[ P_x = P_0 \times (1 - 0.05)^x \]

We know that after some months, the remaining funds are approximately \$15,000. We can use this information to find out how many months have passed before the first withdrawal.

Since the exact number of months is not specified, let's assume that the first withdrawal occurs after the funds have reached \$15,000. We need to find out how much was withdrawn in that first month.

If the remaining funds after the first withdrawal are \$15,000, then the amount withdrawn in the first month is:
\[ \text{Withdrawal} = P_0 - P_1 \]

However, without the exact number of months, we cannot calculate this precisely. But we know that the first withdrawal will be 5% of the remaining funds at the beginning of that month.

Given that the funds after some months are approximately \$15,000, we can infer that the first withdrawal occurred after the funds had decreased to about \$15,000.

Therefore, the first withdrawal amount would be:
\[ \text{Withdrawal} = \$50,000 \times 0.05 = \$2,500 \]

Thus, the first withdrawal amount is \$2,500.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{2500}\]
