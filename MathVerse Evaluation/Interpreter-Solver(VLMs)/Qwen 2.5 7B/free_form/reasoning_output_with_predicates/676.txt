To solve the problem of finding the surface area of the solid formed by cutting out a quarter of a sphere from a cube, let's break down the solution step-by-step.

### Step 1: Identify the dimensions and shapes involved
- The cube has a side length of \(14.2\) cm.
- The radius of the sphere is given as \(7.1\) cm.
- The sphere's diameter is twice the radius, so it is \(14.2\) cm.
- Since the sphere's diameter is equal to the side length of the cube, the sphere fits perfectly inside the cube such that its center coincides with the center of the cube.

### Step 2: Calculate the surface area of the cube
The surface area \(A_{\text{cube}}\) of a cube with side length \(a\) is given by:
\[ A_{\text{cube}} = 6a^2 \]
Substituting \(a = 14.2\) cm:
\[ A_{\text{cube}} = 6 \times (14.2)^2 = 6 \times 201.64 = 1209.84 \text{ cm}^2 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the surface area of the quarter sphere
The surface area \(A_{\text{sphere}}\) of a full sphere with radius \(r\) is given by:
\[ A_{\text{sphere}} = 4\pi r^2 \]
Since we are dealing with a quarter sphere, the surface area of the quarter sphere is:
\[ A_{\text{quarter sphere}} = \frac{1}{4} \times 4\pi r^2 = \pi r^2 \]
Substituting \(r = 7.1\) cm:
\[ A_{\text{quarter sphere}} = \pi \times (7.1)^2 = \pi \times 50.41 = 50.41\pi \text{ cm}^2 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the surface area of the remaining part of the sphere
The remaining part of the sphere after removing the quarter sphere includes a cap and a circular base. The cap's surface area is the same as the quarter sphere's surface area, which is \(50.41\pi\) cm². The circular base of the cap has an area:
\[ A_{\text{base}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \times (7.1)^2 = 50.41\pi \text{ cm}^2 \]
Thus, the total surface area of the remaining part of the sphere is:
\[ A_{\text{remaining sphere}} = 50.41\pi + 50.41\pi = 100.82\pi \text{ cm}^2 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total surface area of the solid
The total surface area of the solid is the sum of the surface area of the cube minus the area of the two faces that were cut off (each face is a square with area \(14.2^2 = 201.64\) cm²):
\[ A_{\text{total}} = A_{\text{cube}} - 2 \times 201.64 + A_{\text{remaining sphere}} = 1209.84 - 403.28 + 100.82\pi \]
\[ A_{\text{total}} = 806.56 + 100.82\pi \text{ cm}^2 \]

### Final Answer:
The surface area of the solid is:
\[ \boxed{806.56 + 100.82\pi \text{ cm}^2} \]
