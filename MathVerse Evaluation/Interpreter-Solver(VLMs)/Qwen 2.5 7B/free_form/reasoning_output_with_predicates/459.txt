FINAL RESPONSE:

Let's analyze the given information and solve the problem step-by-step.

**Step 1: Analyze the given information**

- We have a circle \( C \) with center at the origin \((0, 0)\).
- The circle passes through the points \((-5, 0)\), \((5, 0)\), \((0, 5)\), and \((0, -5)\).
- The radius of the circle is 5 units because the distance from the center to any of these points is the radius.

**Step 2: Deductive reasoning**

- Since the circle passes through the points \((-5, 0)\), \((5, 0)\), \((0, 5)\), and \((0, -5)\), the center of the circle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).
- The radius of the circle is 5 units, which means that every point on the circle is 5 units away from the center \((0, 0)\).

**Step 3: Conclusion**

- Therefore, every point on the circle is exactly 5 units away from the point \((0, 0)\).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{5}\]
