QUESTION:
The function $f(x)=5 x-x^2$ in blue gives the number of mosquitos in the forest (in millions), and the function $g(x)=3 x-0.5 x^2$ in red gives the number of bats (in millions). In both equations $x$ represents rainfall (in centimeters). $g(x)$ goes through (0,0), (3,6), (6,0) and opens downward. $f(x)$ in blue goes through (0,0), (2,6), (3,6), (5,0) and opens downsward. When there is $0 \mathrm{~cm}$ of rainfall, the number of mosquitos is the same as the number of bats. What is another rainfall amount where the number of mosquitos is the same as the number of bats?
Round your answer to the nearest half centimeter.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to find the rainfall \( x \) where the number of mosquitoes (\( f(x) \)) is equal to the number of bats (\( g(x) \)).

Given:
\[ f(x) = 5x - x^2 \]
\[ g(x) = 3x - 0.5x^2 \]

We need to find \( x \) such that \( f(x) = g(x) \).

Set the equations equal to each other:
\[ 5x - x^2 = 3x - 0.5x^2 \]

Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving \( x \):
\[ 5x - x^2 - 3x + 0.5x^2 = 0 \]
\[ 2x - 0.5x^2 = 0 \]

Factor out \( x \):
\[ x(2 - 0.5x) = 0 \]

This gives us two solutions:
\[ x = 0 \]
\[ 2 - 0.5x = 0 \]
\[ 0.5x = 2 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

We know from the problem statement that at \( x = 0 \), the number of mosquitoes and bats is the same. We need to check if there is another value of \( x \) where the number of mosquitoes equals the number of bats.

Since \( x = 0 \) already satisfies the condition, we look for another intersection point. The quadratic equation \( 0.5x = 2 \) yields \( x = 4 \).

Thus, the rainfall amount where the number of mosquitoes is the same as the number of bats is \( x = 4 \) cm.

Final Answer: \(\boxed{4}\)
