QUESTION:
A vertical blue line in the graph. What is the equation of the line?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- We have a vertical blue line passing through the origin (0,0).
- The line is aligned with the y-axis.
- The equation of a vertical line that passes through the origin can be written as \( x = 0 \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
- From the given predicates, we know that the line passes through the origin.
- Since the line is vertical and passes through the origin, it can only be described as \( x = 0 \).
- The equation \( x = 0 \) describes a line that is parallel to the y-axis and intersects the x-axis at the origin.

### Conclusion and Selection
- The equation of the vertical blue line is \( x = 0 \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{x = 0}\]
