QUESTION:
A rally car starts at point P and races 191 kilometres south to point Q. Here the car turns west and races for 83 kilometres to point R. At point R the car must turn to head directly back to point P.

What is the compass bearing of R from P? Give your answer to one decimal place.

FINAL RESPONSE:

Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the given information and geometric principles.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

From the given information:
- Point \(P\) is the starting point.
- The car travels 191 km south to reach point \(Q\).
- The car then travels 83 km west to reach point \(R\).
- We need to determine the compass bearing of \(R\) from \(P\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify Key Relationships
- Since the car travels directly south from \(P\) to \(Q\), the distance \(PQ = 191\) km.
- Then, the car travels directly west from \(Q\) to \(R\), so \(QR = 83\) km.
- The angle at \(Q\) between the south direction and the west direction is \(90^\circ\) because it forms a right angle with the perpendicular lines.

#### Step 2.2: Calculate the Bearing
- To find the compass bearing of \(R\) from \(P\), we need to determine the angle \(\alpha\) that the line segment \(PR\) makes with the north direction.

#### Step 2.3: Use the Pythagorean Theorem
- In the right triangle \(PQR\), we know the lengths of the legs \(PQ = 191\) km and \(QR = 83\) km.
- The hypotenuse \(PR\) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  PR = \sqrt{PQ^2 + QR^2} = \sqrt{191^2 + 83^2}
  \]
  \[
  PR = \sqrt{36481 + 6889} = \sqrt{43370} \approx 208.26 \text{ km}
  \]

#### Step 2.4: Determine the Angle \(\alpha\)
- The angle \(\alpha\) is the angle between the line \(PR\) and the north direction.
- Since \(\angle PQR = 90^\circ\), the angle \(\alpha\) can be found using the tangent function:
  \[
  \tan(\alpha) = \frac{QR}{PQ} = \frac{83}{191}
  \]
  \[
  \alpha = \arctan\left(\frac{83}{191}\right) \approx 22.9^\circ
  \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
- The compass bearing of \(R\) from \(P\) is measured clockwise from north.
- Therefore, the bearing is \(22.9^\circ\) west of south.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{22.9}\]
