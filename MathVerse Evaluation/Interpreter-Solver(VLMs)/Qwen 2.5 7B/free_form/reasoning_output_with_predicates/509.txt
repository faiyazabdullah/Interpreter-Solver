QUESTION:
A line is parallel to x-axis at y=5. Write the inequality that describes the points in the shaded region.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**

- The image shows a horizontal line at \( y = 5 \).
- The predicate states that the line \( l \) is parallel to the x-axis at \( y = 5 \). This means the line \( l \) has a constant \( y \)-coordinate of 5.
- The shaded region is bounded by the line \( l \).

**Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

1. **Identify the Line and Shading**:
   - The line \( l \) is parallel to the x-axis and intersects it at \( y = 5 \).
   - The shading suggests that the area is bounded by this line.

2. **Determine the Inequality**:
   - Since the line \( l \) is at \( y = 5 \) and the shaded region extends infinitely in the x-direction, the inequality describing the shaded region would be all points \((x, y)\) such that \( y \geq 5 \).

3. **Formulate the Final Answer**:
   - The inequality that describes the shaded region is \( y \geq 5 \).

**Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**

Final Answer: \[\boxed{y \geq 5}\]
