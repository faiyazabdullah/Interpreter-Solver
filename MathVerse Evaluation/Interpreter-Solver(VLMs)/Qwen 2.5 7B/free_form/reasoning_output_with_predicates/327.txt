QUESTION:
During a rescue search, a helicopter flew b kilometres west from point X to point Y, then changed course and flew 10.7 kilometres north to point Z. If point Z is on a bearing of 335Â° T from point X:

Now, if the distance that the helicopter must fly between point Z and point X is d kilometres, calculate d to one decimal place.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

- We know \(XY = b\) km.
- \(YZ = 10.7\) km.
- Point \(Z\) is on a bearing of \(335^\circ\) T from point \(X\).
- We need to find \(d = ZX\).

From the given angles:
- \(\angle ZXY = 90^\circ\) because the helicopter changes direction to fly north.
- \(\angle XZY = 25^\circ\) and \(\angle ZXY = 65^\circ\).

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. Since \(\angle ZXY = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle XZY = 25^\circ\), we have \(\angle ZYX = 65^\circ\). This is consistent with the given information.
2. In right triangle \(XYZ\), we can use trigonometry to find \(d = ZX\).

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d^2 = XY^2 + YZ^2 \]
\[ d^2 = b^2 + 10.7^2 \]
\[ d^2 = b^2 + 114.49 \]

Given that \(b\) is the distance traveled west, and there is no direct information about \(b\), we assume \(b\) is part of the problem but not specified. However, since the problem asks us to find \(d\) in terms of \(b\) and the known value, we can express \(d\) as:
\[ d = \sqrt{b^2 + 114.49} \]

Since we don't have a specific value for \(b\), we cannot compute a numerical value for \(d\). However, if \(b\) were given, we could substitute it into the equation.

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

The problem does not provide a specific value for \(b\), so we express \(d\) in terms of \(b\):
\[ d = \sqrt{b^2 + 114.49} \]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{\sqrt{b^2 + 114.49}}\]
