QUESTION:
The diagram shows a water trough in the shape of a half cylinder. The height is 2.49 m and radius is 0.92 m.

Find the surface area of the outside of this water trough.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's break down the problem step-by-step and apply the given geometric relationships.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- The geometric figure is a water trough shaped like a half cylinder.
- The height of the trough (which is also the radius of the semicircle) is \( r = 0.92 \, \text{m} \).
- The length of the trough is \( L = 2.49 \, \text{m} \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Calculate the Curved Surface Area
The curved surface area of a half cylinder (semicircular cylinder) is given by:
\[ \text{Curved Surface Area} = \pi r L \]
Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Curved Surface Area} = \pi \times 0.92 \times 2.49 \]

#### Step 2.2: Calculate the Rectangle Area
The rectangle's width is the diameter of the semicircle, which is \( 2r = 2 \times 0.92 = 1.84 \, \text{m} \). The length of the rectangle is the same as the length of the trough, \( L = 2.49 \, \text{m} \).
\[ \text{Rectangle Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 2.49 \times 1.84 \]

#### Step 2.3: Calculate the Total Surface Area
The total surface area is the sum of the curved surface area and the rectangle area.
\[ \text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Curved Surface Area} + \text{Rectangle Area} \]

#### Step 2.4: Perform the Calculations
First, calculate the curved surface area:
\[ \text{Curved Surface Area} = \pi \times 0.92 \times 2.49 \approx 6.94 \, \text{m}^2 \]

Next, calculate the rectangle area:
\[ \text{Rectangle Area} = 2.49 \times 1.84 \approx 4.55 \, \text{m}^2 \]

Finally, add these two areas to get the total surface area:
\[ \text{Total Surface Area} = 6.94 + 4.55 = 11.49 \, \text{m}^2 \]

### Final Answer
\[ \boxed{11.49} \]
