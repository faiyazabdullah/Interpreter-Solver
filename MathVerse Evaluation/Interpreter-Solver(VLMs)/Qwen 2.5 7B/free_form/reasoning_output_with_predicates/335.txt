QUESTION:
Consider the point A. The angle between line OA and the south direction is 32°.

What is the true bearing of A from O?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- The image shows a coordinate system with Point O at the origin.
- Line OA forms an angle of 32° with the South direction.
- The South direction corresponds to the negative y-axis.
- We need to determine the true bearing of A from O.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**
- Since the angle between line OA and the South direction is 32°, we know that the angle between line OA and the East direction (which is 90° from South) is 90° - 32° = 58°.
- The true bearing of a point from a reference point in navigation is measured clockwise from North.
- Therefore, the true bearing of A from O is 90° + 58° = 148°.

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
- Based on the deductive reasoning, the true bearing of A from O is 148°.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{148^\circ}\]
