QUESTION:
Consider the points on the diagram P, M and S where S denotes the south cardinal point. Angle PMS is 50Â°.

Using the diagram, find the true bearing of P from M.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- We have points \( P \), \( M \), and \( S \).
- \( S \) is the south cardinal point.
- \( \angle PMS = 50^\circ \).

The bearing of \( P \) from \( M \) is typically measured clockwise from the north direction. Since \( S \) is the south point, the north direction is directly opposite to it. Therefore, we need to determine the bearing that starts from the north and goes clockwise to reach point \( P \).

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**
- The angle \( \angle PMS \) is given as \( 50^\circ \).
- Since \( S \) is the south point, the north direction is directly above \( S \).
- The bearing of \( P \) from \( M \) will be \( 90^\circ + 50^\circ = 140^\circ \).

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
- The bearing of \( P \) from \( M \) is \( 140^\circ \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{140^\circ}\]
