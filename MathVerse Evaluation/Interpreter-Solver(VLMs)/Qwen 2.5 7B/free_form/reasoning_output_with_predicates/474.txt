QUESTION:
There are two points at -2 and 1 on the number line. Write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the given predicates and the information from the image.

**Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**
- The image shows a number line with two points marked: -2 and -1.
- There is no indication of any other points or segments between these two points.
- The predicates indicate that there are two points at -2 and 1, but the image only shows points at -2 and -1.

**Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**
- Since the image only shows points at -2 and -1, and there is no indication of a point at 1, we will focus on the interval between -2 and -1.
- The interval notation for the set of numbers represented on the number line includes all numbers greater than -2 and less than -1.

**Conclusion and Selection**
- The interval notation for the set of numbers between -2 and -1 is \((-2, -1)\).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{(-2, -1)}\]
