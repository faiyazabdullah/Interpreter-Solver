QUESTION:
Find the surface area of the pyramid. The perpendicular height is 8mm. The base is a square with the edge of 10mm. Include all faces in your calculations.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the surface area of the pyramid, we need to calculate the area of the base and the area of the four triangular faces.

### Step 1: Calculate the area of the base
The base is a square with side length \(10 \, \text{mm}\).
\[
\text{Area of the base} = 10 \times 10 = 100 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of one triangular face
Each triangular face is a right triangle with the height of the pyramid as one leg and half the diagonal of the square base as the other leg. First, we need to find the length of the diagonal of the square base.
\[
\text{Diagonal of the base} = \sqrt{10^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2} \, \text{mm}
\]
The length of the leg opposite the height (half of the diagonal) is:
\[
\text{Leg} = \frac{10\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\sqrt{2} \, \text{mm}
\]
The area of one triangular face is:
\[
\text{Area of one triangular face} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 8 = 40 \, \text{mm}^2
\]
Since there are four triangular faces, the total area of the four triangular faces is:
\[
4 \times 40 = 160 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total surface area of the pyramid
The total surface area is the sum of the area of the base and the areas of the four triangular faces.
\[
\text{Total surface area} = 100 + 160 = 260 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{260}
\]
