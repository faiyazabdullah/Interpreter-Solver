QUESTION:
The top of a solid cone was sawed off to form the solid attached. The top cone has a diameter of 8cm and slant height of 8cm. The solid cone has a diameter of 4cm. The solid left has a slant height of 8cm. Find the surface area of the solid formed, correct to two decimal places.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- The original cone had a diameter of 8 cm and a slant height of 8 cm.
- The smaller cone that was cut off had a diameter of 4 cm.
- The remaining solid cone has a diameter of 4 cm and a slant height of 8 cm.
- We need to find the surface area of the resulting solid, which includes the lateral surface area of the smaller cone removed plus the lateral surface area of the larger cone minus the base area of the smaller cone (which is already included in the larger cone).

#### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Lateral Surface Area of the Original Cone:**
   \[
   \text{Slant height of the original cone} = 8 \text{ cm}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Diameter of the original cone} = 8 \text{ cm} \implies \text{Radius} = 4 \text{ cm}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Lateral Surface Area} = \pi \times \text{Radius} \times \text{Slant height} = \pi \times 4 \times 8 = 32\pi \text{ cm}^2
   \]

2. **Lateral Surface Area of the Smaller Cone:**
   \[
   \text{Slant height of the smaller cone} = 8 \text{ cm}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Diameter of the smaller cone} = 4 \text{ cm} \implies \text{Radius} = 2 \text{ cm}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Lateral Surface Area} = \pi \times \text{Radius} \times \text{Slant height} = \pi \times 2 \times 8 = 16\pi \text{ cm}^2
   \]

3. **Total Lateral Surface Area of the Resulting Solid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Lateral Surface Area} = \text{Lateral Surface Area of the original cone} - \text{Lateral Surface Area of the smaller cone} + \text{Lateral Surface Area of the remaining cone}
   \]
   \[
   = 32\pi - 16\pi + 32\pi = 48\pi \text{ cm}^2
   \]

4. **Base Area of the Smaller Cone:**
   \[
   \text{Base Area of the smaller cone} = \pi \times \text{Radius}^2 = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi \text{ cm}^2
   \]

5. **Total Surface Area of the Resulting Solid:**
   Since the base of the smaller cone is not visible, we do not subtract the base area of the smaller cone because it is already included in the larger cone's base area.

Thus, the total surface area of the resulting solid is:
\[
48\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

#### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
Final Answer: \[\boxed{48\pi}\]
