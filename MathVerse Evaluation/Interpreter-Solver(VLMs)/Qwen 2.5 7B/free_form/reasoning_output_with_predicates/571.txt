QUESTION:
There are two quadratic functions. The red one is g(x) that goes through the origin and point (2, -4). Find the equation of the dashed line in red. Use exact numbers.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given problem step-by-step using the information from the image and the predicates provided.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- The red line \( g \) passes through the origin \((0, 0)\).
- The red line \( g \) also passes through the point \((2, -4)\).
- We need to find the equation of the line \( g \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Equation of Line \( g \)**:
   Since \( g \) passes through the origin \((0, 0)\), it is in the form \( y = mx \), where \( m \) is the slope.
   
2. **Finding the Slope \( m \)**:
   The slope \( m \) can be calculated using the two points \((0, 0)\) and \((2, -4)\):
   \[
   m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{-4 - 0}{2 - 0} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2
   \]

3. **Equation of Line \( g \)**:
   Using the slope \( m = -2 \) and the point-slope form \( y = mx \), the equation of the line \( g \) is:
   \[
   y = -2x
   \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The equation of the dashed line \( g \) is \( y = -2x \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{y = -2x}\]
