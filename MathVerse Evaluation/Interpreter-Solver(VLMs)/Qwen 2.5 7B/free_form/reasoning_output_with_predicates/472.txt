QUESTION:
The following graph shows a semicircle which passes (-7,0), (-5,-5), (0,7), (5,-5), (7,0).

State the centre of the semicircle.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given information step-by-step to determine the center of the semicircle.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- The given points lie on the semicircle: \( A = (-7, 0) \), \( B = (-5, -5) \), \( C = (0, -7) \), \( D = (5, -5) \), \( E = (7, 0) \).
- The semicircle is centered at some point \( (h, k) \) and has a radius \( r \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify the center of the semicircle**:
   Since the semicircle passes through these points, the center \( (h, k) \) must be equidistant from all these points. This means that the distances from the center to each of the points must be equal.

2. **Calculate the distance from the center to any point on the semicircle**:
   The distance formula between two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
   \]

3. **Set up equations for distances**:
   Let's set the distance from the center \( (h, k) \) to point \( A = (-7, 0) \):
   \[
   \sqrt{(h + 7)^2 + k^2} = r
   \]
   Similarly, set the distance to point \( B = (-5, -5) \):
   \[
   \sqrt{(h + 5)^2 + (k + 5)^2} = r
   \]

4. **Equate the distances**:
   Since the radius is the same for all points, we can equate the squared distances:
   \[
   (h + 7)^2 + k^2 = (h + 5)^2 + (k + 5)^2
   \]

5. **Expand and simplify the equation**:
   Expand both sides:
   \[
   h^2 + 14h + 49 + k^2 = h^2 + 10h + 25 + k^2 + 10k + 25
   \]
   Simplify by canceling out common terms:
   \[
   14h + 49 = 10h + 50 + 10k
   \]
   Rearrange to solve for \( k \):
   \[
   4h - 10k = 1
   \]
   \[
   2h - 5k = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

6. **Find the intersection of the lines formed by the points**:
   To find the exact center, we need to check if there is a common center that satisfies the above equation. By inspection or solving the system of equations, we see that the center lies at the midpoint of the perpendicular bisectors of the chords formed by the points.

7. **Identify the center**:
   From the symmetry of the points, the center appears to be at the origin \( (0, 0) \). This is because the points form a symmetrical pattern around the origin, suggesting that the center is at the midpoint of the diameter of the semicircle.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The center of the semicircle is at the origin \( (0, 0) \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{(0, 0)}\]
