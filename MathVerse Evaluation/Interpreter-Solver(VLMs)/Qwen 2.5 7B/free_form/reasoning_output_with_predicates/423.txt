QUESTION:
After two meteoroids collide at point A, one starts travelling in the direction of point B, while the other starts travelling in the direction of point C, with an angle of 53^\circ  between the two directions. The meteoroid projected in the direction of B is moving at a speed of 7860 km/h, while the other is moving at a speed of 10170 km/h.


What distance will the meteoroid travelling towards point B have covered after 29 minutes?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- We know the speed of the meteoroid traveling towards point B is \(7860 \text{ km/h}\).
- We need to determine the distance traveled by this meteoroid in 29 minutes.
- The angle between the directions of points B and C is \(53^\circ\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Convert time to hours**: Since the speed is given in km/h, convert 29 minutes into hours.
   \[
   29 \text{ minutes} = \frac{29}{60} \text{ hours}
   \]
2. **Calculate distance**: Use the formula \( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \).
   \[
   \text{Distance}_B = 7860 \text{ km/h} \times \frac{29}{60} \text{ h}
   \]
3. **Perform the multiplication**:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_B = 7860 \times \frac{29}{60} = 7860 \times 0.483333 \approx 3785.11 \text{ km}
   \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The distance that the meteoroid traveling towards point B will have covered after 29 minutes is approximately \(3785.11\) kilometers.

\[
\boxed{3785.11}
\]
