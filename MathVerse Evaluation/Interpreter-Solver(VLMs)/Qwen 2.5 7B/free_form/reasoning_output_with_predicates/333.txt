QUESTION:
Consider the points on the diagram P, M and S where S denotes the south cardinal point. Angle PMS is 37Â°.

Using the diagram, find the true bearing of P from M.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometric relationships in the diagram.

**Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**

- We know that Point \(P\) lies on the line segment \(MP\).
- The measure of angle \(PMS\) is \(37^\circ\).
- The circle is centered at \(M\) and passes through Point \(P\).

**Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

We need to determine the true bearing of \(P\) from \(M\). The bearing of a point \(P\) from \(M\) is measured clockwise from the north direction.

1. Since \(P\) lies on the line segment \(MP\) and \(M\) is the center of the circle, \(MP\) is a radius of the circle. Therefore, \(M\) is directly above \(P\) when considering the direction from \(M\) to \(P\).

2. The angle \(PMS\) is given as \(37^\circ\). This angle is formed between the line segment \(MP\) and the vertical line passing through \(M\) (which is the south direction since \(S\) is the south cardinal point).

3. To find the true bearing of \(P\) from \(M\), we need to consider the direction from \(M\) to \(P\) relative to the north direction. The bearing will be \(360^\circ - 37^\circ = 323^\circ\). This is because \(37^\circ\) is measured clockwise from the north direction, so the bearing from \(M\) to \(P\) is \(360^\circ - 37^\circ = 323^\circ\).

**Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**

The true bearing of \(P\) from \(M\) is \(323^\circ\).

Final Answer: \(\boxed{323^\circ}\)
